and it was this union oi the Doric element with the Attie that gave
rise to the tradition that Susarion, an inhabitant of the Doric city of
Megara, was the inventor oi Attic comedy. According to this tra-
dition, Susarion, about 580 Β. a, uansplanted the Doric iarce to the
Attio dente of Icaria, which was known as the chief seat ot the wor-
ship oi Dionysus in Attica. There the union referred to took place.

Eupolis, Cratinus and Phrynichus. Of the works of thess writers only
fragments remain. But Aristophanes, who was but a little younger
than they, 'has leit us eleven plays, and has surpassed all his rivale in ³
