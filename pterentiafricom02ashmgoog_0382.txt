Didascalla (artaxata) was a term applied by the Greeks to the traiuing
01 the chorus aud the actors for adramatic performanoe. It was used also oi
the places thus brought iorward at 1 dramatic entertainmeut, aud again
01 certain public notices (hung up in the theatre) in which were given tha
names 01 the comparing poete, and the titles 01 their plays, as well as im·
portant dates, names 01 actors and 01101191, and other matters connected with
the dramatic contests. Documenta such as these were systematically pre-
pared, hy Alexandrian scholare, upon particular tragedias and comodies;
and 110111 1511 Β. 0. downward the Roman grammariaus imitated this custom
in the interest 01 their own dramatic writers. Prominent among these
Roman grammarians was Marcus Terentius Varro, who lived from 116 10
1110, The didascaliaa inserted in the MSS. 01 Plautina and Terentian
comedies rest largely 011 his authority. They are given in the 101111 01 pre·
fatory notices, whose purpose is to make known, as a sort 01 advertisement,
the source or origin 01 each play, and the time and circumstances 01 111 first
representation. The didmratiaa 01 Terence are in tha main complate; those
01 Plautus are merely fragmentary, except that attached 10 the Stichus.

In consequence 01 the destruction oi the first leaves 01 the (lodex Bem-

difficulty on the analogy 01 the didascalica to the other plays, and through
