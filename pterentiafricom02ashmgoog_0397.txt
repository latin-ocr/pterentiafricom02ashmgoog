ι 16 NOTES

102. placuit, “I agreed '’; often without a dat. despondi (sc. 0111), “Ι
promised him in marriage.” This verb is commonly used oi promising a
daughter in marriage, as in Heoal. 779. That the legality oi amarriage
contract should depend on a formal betrothal‚ in which the consent of the
parents or guardians oi the young people was a necessary iactor, was
owing mainly to the seclusion in which the women oi a family were kept
in both Graece and Rome, as well as to the power oi the putria potestas,
which a 1101111111 father exercised over his sons. In the present instance it is
evident from the sequel that Pamphilus had not even seen the daughter oi
Chremes, to whom he is thus betrothed by his' own father. In Rome tbe
consent of the bride’s iatber had first to be obtained. Here it is given gra·
tuitously. The simplest form oi betrothal appears in Plaut. Pacu. 1157:
Ag. 1101110010 luituri Ha. apamien.

Transl. “what then is in the way of the marriage (1011111111) taking
place ?’'

104. iere in diebus paucis qulbus, “very shortly aiter.’' Cf. the
Spanish ‘⁸ 01 poem dius quc.'' scra goes with paucis, “a couple of days or
so.'' quibas is illogical; we should expect postquam. Cf. Caes. B. G. 3. 23
paucis dicem 011311 00 acutum 0101.

105. uicina haec, ‘⁶ our neighbour irere.'’ iactum bene: an expression
of joy over the happy ending oi some matter that causes anxiety; cf. 939,
975. The opposite is malefactum, as in Pmm. 751. In these expressions
cel is regularly omitted.

106. beasti (se. 110), “ you delight me '’ ; ef. Ε11. 279. ι Chryside ex-

presses the source 01 his isar, cf. Liv. 28. 31100 Hannibale 11011110. ¹

ibi turn. “ thereupon,” ‘⁶ then’'; a pleonasm of the sermo cottidianus. cf.

verb, asineoalouda, 0011111110, etc. Compounds 01001- are moro numerous
. than those with any other prefix; most of these compormds belong to tbs

early period. See (looper, Woru Formation lo lile Roman Sermo Plebeiae,
pp. 363-271. The word may mean also that he wept in sympathy with tbe
