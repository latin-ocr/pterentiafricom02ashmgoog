INTRODUCTION 35

of Roman. comedy was anything but favourable. But the elegantia,

or retinement and grace of idiom, which characterized Terence's writ-
ings was undoubtedly secured at the expense of vigour, spontaneity‚
and the power to express passion and depth of feeling. The absence
of these qualities was noticed by Caesar, who, in spite of his admira·
tion for Terence’s style, regrets the lach in him of a certain ais
meaa, the presence oi which would have rendered his productione
“ equal to those of the Greeks”; and Terence’s enemies, cver'keen to
seize such an opportunity, cast the same in his teeth (cf. Pacem.
Prol. 5). Moreover Volcatius Sedigitus would hardly have placed
Terence so low as sixtb in his list of the ten most noted writers of
palliatae but for this recognized defeat, - unless indeed the fact were
due to the tradition oi the Collegium Poetarum, “which remained
permanently hostile to the favourite of Scipio Aemilianus.”¹

54. After the death of Terence the only noteworthy writer of pal·
llatae was Snxrns Thamnus, who lived till 103 n. a, but probably
ceased to write before that time. ·Thirteen titles in Greek and a few
fragments of the plays are allwe have oi his writings. The close of the
sixthcentnry u. c., says Teuffel, coincides with the end oi the palliatae.
The plays oi Plautus and Terence continued to be represented on the
stage, bnt new dramas of this kind were seldom forthcoming. It was
atthis period that the Cononnln Toanrn first acquired popular favour. ¹
1. Afranius and Τ. Quintius Atta were its chief representatives‚ and
to Afranius especially was accorded in ancient times no small measure
oi appreciation and applause. But this form oi comedy never attained
the success which fell to the lot of the comoedia palliata, and its place
was soon shared by other forms of the comic art, through a resuscita·
tion in literary dress oi the fabulae Atellanae and the mimi. The risa
of the mimus in particular did much to degrade the Ronm stage in the
later *days of the Republic and under the Empire. ln Imperial times

the plays of Plautus and Terence, though often admired and expounded -

by commentatore and critics, were seldom presented in the theatres,
where the “ grass buffooneries of the Atehan {arce ” and the indecent
gestures and hilarity of the mimes ² held abnost undisputed away. Thus
