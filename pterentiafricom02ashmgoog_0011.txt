vi PREFACE

so far as possible, bis own commentator. Consequently I have
indulged in cross-refcrences to an extent that may seem exces-
sive. Yet this method hasbeen justified, I think, by the fact
that in no other way could sc many plays be annotated in a
single volume, without much burdensome repetition.

The references ιο Latin grammars are intended merely tc con- ἑ
firm or emphasiae the explanatione offered in the Notas, and have ¹
been given, in each instance, ιο the grammar or grammars ἵ
which seemed tc throw the clearest light on the difficulty in
question. American Latin grammm are now so numerous that
parallel references to all of them would have greatly encumbered
the book. Morecver the college student should be encouraged
tc use bis grammar, and ιο find what be needs there, without
the aid of references.

Although experience points directly tc the fact that American
studente are seldom called upon tc read either the Eunuchus or
the Hecyra-yet Ι have not, ou that account, greatly shortened
the commentaries on these plays. It has been my wisb todo
such justice to each comedy as the space at my command would
allow, and tc be guided rather by the nature ol the difficulties
in the text than by any prevailing prejudice either for or against
the subject-matter of the play itself.

Though it w'ould not be pertinent here to discuss at length
the rnerits of the plays, yet it may be said that if judged frum ,
the standpoint of the Greeks and Romans, whose life and habits ,
they portray, the comedies of Terence will be found to lean
always tc the side of true morality. Asto the reputed difference
in moral tone between the Eunuchus and the [noym on the one
hand, and the rest of the Terentina comedies on the other, I
cannot bnt think that the marked distinction usually made to
the discredit of the former is hardly based on sound judgment,
and that, if followed to its logical conclusion, it should lead to
