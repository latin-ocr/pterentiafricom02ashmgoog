,4 INTRODUCTION

less note are Philippides (or Phidippides)‚ Apollodorus and Posidip ²
pus. These six names are also the most important in connection with
the comedy of the Romans Unfortuuately only fragments of their ,
works have survived3 but these are sufficient in number and character l
to throw a fair light on the general characteristics of this particular
phase oi the Greek drama. ·

6. The N ew Comedy drew its materiale almost entirely from private · r
life. It was essentially a comedy oi manners, into which personal and
political satire, so characteristic oi the comedy of Aristophanes (ξ 3),
entered but slightly. Even the literarysatireoi theMiddleComedycould 1
scarcely be traced in it 'Such satire as it expressed arnounted merely ¹
to a mild caricature oi folly in the abstract, — sufficient to add humour
and piquancy to the portrayal of character, but in no sense calculated
to offend. It was to the Old comedy what the satire of Horace was to
that of Lucilius. Its nearest modern analogue is the comedy oi Muliere. l
The characters of the New Comedy were in general fictitious‚ and could
seldom be identified with any well-known person oi importance. They
represented familiar types or classes rather than individuale, and in
this particular resembled the caricatures of Epicharmus (ξ 2). l

7. Among these types were the stern father and the indulgent
uncle, the steady and the wayward son, the rapacious and also the dis·
interested courtesan, the good slave aud the slave who was tricky
and deceitiul, the upstart, the aristocrat‚ and the boastful captain of
mercenaries, -types already extensively ioreshadowed in the dranm
of Sicily, and common to the every-day life oi the Greek people. Each
character had its appropriate mask aud make-up, and was recognized
atonce by the audience at the moment of ite appearance on the stage.
The old man might be known by his white or gray hair. Black hair
denoted the young gentleman‚ long and shaggy hair the soldier, red
hair the slave. The complexion of the soldier was dark, as if suuburned,
that of the lover pale. The rogue was endowed with cheeks oi a bril-
liant red. Hook noses were given to old men aad parasites, flat nosce
to'country youths; if the ears showed signs of bruises the person
must have frequented the boxingcchool.¹ ,
