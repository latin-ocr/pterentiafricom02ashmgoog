spectator-s was first reecrved ior senators and other perenne oi distinction
(Liv. 34. 44). A small theatro on theGreek plenalunium ct pro-
scaenium, Liv. 40. 51), with stage of stone, was erected 1117911.
near the temple oi Apollo, but was soon afterward pulled down. Ageln,
in 17 4 Β. 1., on effert was made to secure the erection oi a permanent
stage. Thiswas anthoriced by the censore (1114127) ; but tho epec- ·
tatore were compelled as before to 111511, and there ie 111111 to believe
that the structure wae demoliehed soon alter 151 conclusion oi the per-
iormanoc ior which it was built. In 155 n. 1., not long aiter the death
of Terence, a stone theatro, with eeats for the spectatore, was begnn hy

C. Cassius Longinus, bnt the next year P. Scipio Nasica induced the
senate to prohibit the building oi a perinanent stage, and the structure
commenced by Longinus was demolished. ln fact, repeated hindrances
and restrictione were placed in the way of theatrical exhibitione,

on the ground that they encouraged a taste for Greek luxury and

hastened the corruption oi the Roman youth. The prejudice, how· ψ ’

ever, was eventually‚ though slowly‚ overcome. ln 145 n. o.‚ a theatro
was built on a larger scale than usual, consisting not only of 111131-
platform and scaena, bnt of side-walls and cauea with scats, as in the
theatre of the Greeks. But this too was made oi wood and was de·
stroyed after it had eerved ite immediate purpose.

69. It was not until the year 55 n. o. that a permanent theatro was
erected in Rome when Pompey the Great constructed one oi stone in
the Campus Martius, and rendered it complete in all particulare. This
building‚ according to Pliny (N. H. 36. 115), was capable oi seating
40‚000 spectatore‚-—probably an exaggeration.¹ No vestigo ol Pompey’s
theatre remaine to be seen, except a line of curvatnrc in the street 1511
now covers a pert of the ground where the cauea once stood. Two
similar theatree were constructed and opened in 131³. 0., one hy Angus-
tus‚.the other by Cornelius Balbus. The latter has periehed utterly.
‚ The former, which was named by ite builder alter his nephew Mar·
celius, has survived in part and constitutos to-day one oi the most
interesting of the ruine of ancient Rome.

70. The Roman theatre‚ in its main features, was like the Greek.
