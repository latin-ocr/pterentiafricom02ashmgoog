nation oi soldiers, without polish, and almost wholly lacking -iu literary
sense3 hence Plautus was compelled to bring down, as it were, the fine {
productione oi Menander aud Philemon to the level oi their clownish l
and more or less brutal tastes. But he was capable of higher things,
and his efforts were in general directed toward the improvement oi y
the public toste and character. Had he lived in a more refined gener·

ation he certainly would not have provohed the unfavourable criti· y

cism of Horace (Epist. 2. 1. 170 ih). Cicero and Varro and Aelius y
Stilo1 speah in his praise, and in modern times his influence upon lit· ἶ
erature has been extensive. Especially did he do much to improve the
Latin lang'uage, which underwent, at his hands, a process of cultivation
and enrichment that carried it iar on its way towards its subsequent
classical perfectiori. His epitaph, mentioned by Varro,² testifies to the
hold he had on his contemporaries, and if written, as Gellius supposed,
hy Plautus himself, exhibits the poet as fully conscious of his own

powers, and of the apprecietion accorded him by the people :-

Postquam est mortem aptus Plautus, Comoedia luget,
Scaena est deserta ao dein Risus, Ludus «locusque
Et Numeri innumeri simul omnes conlacrumerunt: —

on; abandoned is the stage, and thenit was that Laughter, Sport and
Merriment‚ and Rhythms numberless all wept in concert.''⁸

who, as a writer of comedies, comes next after Plautus in time, though l
notin order of merit. There is no evidence to show that his comedies l
met with much success or appreciation. Not one of them has de- l
scended to modern times, 'and even the fragments⁴ are hardly of suf·
ficient importance to deserve notice. In the canon of Sedigitas he
is placed last. He is mentioned, however, in complimentary phrase ¹
by Terence in the prologue to the Andria, though the reference there is
not to the quality of his comedies. But as a writer of tragedias aud of

cal and unrhythmical,” i. e. all sorts. ,
