INTRODUOTION 5

8. The plots, as well as the characters, of the New Comedy diliered
greatly from those of the Old. In the Old Comedy there was a series
of soenes not closely connected through the sequence oi cause and
effect, bnt only loosely held together by a centrel idea, such as “the
attractione oi peace '' in the Armeniam of Aristophanes. The New
Comedy, on the contrary, exhibited a number oi soenes following one
another in logical order, as' in a modern drama. These soenes pertrayed
asnstained story, or at least an intrigue, and resulted in adeonae·
mm, or climax. The central theme was usually the course of true
love, and the action depicted the efforts cf a youth ιο obtain possession
oi his mistress, often in the face oi the determined oppositiones a
parent or guardien, and with the assistance of a triclry slave. The
heroine, who et the start was supposed to belong to the class oi
courtesans or baserne (regarded as aliens), was eventually discovered
to be a well-horn maiden and an Athenian citizen, and her marriage
to the hero oi the play was th'e necessary and suitable conclusion.

9. The importanee attached to the plot in the New Comedy was due,
in part, to the influenee of Euripides, some oi whose tragedies bordered

closely upon the domain of eomedy; his skill in the wearing and un· Ι

ravelling oi plots was conspicuous in comparison with that of the other
famous tragedians. Euripides, rnoreover, brought down tragedy from
the pedestal oi religious ,elevation upon which it hed been placed by
his predecessore, and rendered possible a closer allienee between it and
³ the relatively coarse and ribald productione of the comic stage. Thus
there was ininsed into the latter some of the dignity and refinement
which hed always been characteristic of the tragie muse, and the
eomedy of Aristophanes became regenerated in the eomedy oi Me·
rander. -

10. Oi Menander (ξ 5) ίι may be remarked at this point that he is of
special interest to studente of Terence, since the latter took him ior
a model, largely to the exclusion of other writers; at least five of
the Greek comedian's plays having furnished material for four nithe
six ertsnt dramas of the Latin poet Plautus also imitated Menander,
elthongh Philemon was more often preferred by the earlier and less
refined of the two great Roman eomic writers Menander was a pupil of
the philosopher Theophrastus, and a friend of the philosopher Epicurus,
