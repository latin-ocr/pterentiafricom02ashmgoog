poraries. A certain freedom in verbal rendering and plotconstruction
was necessary to the success of his ert. Lucidity ol thought and such
variety in the aetion as a Roman audience would be sure to demand
were indispensable. Accordingly, Terence refrained from anything that
would resemble mere translation. He did not wish, by following the
example of Lanuvinus, whose poetioal canon was a literal dependenee
on his models in respect of the language aud the plots alike, to make .
poor Latin plays out of good Greek ones(cf.Ean.Pr01.vss. 7-8).
He desired to present to the Roman public, in the purast Latin at his
command, a true picture ol Greek life and manners as given in the
writinge ol the later Greek comedians3 avoiding the licenoe and the
Romenizing tendencies of Plautus, on the one hand, and the feeble
uass and obscurity resulting from extreme literalness, on the other.
Such literalness he conceived to be exemplified iu the compositione .
of plsywrights like Luscius Lanuvinus, as a counteretroke to whose
attsoks upon himself he employs the phrase abraam diligentia in his
prologus to the Andria. In the same prologue he praises the aecle-

roughly rendered “plagiarium'' The Latin word however was not so
broad a term as the English, which has already been applied to the
poet's possible use of the opinions and abilities of his friends in the
Scipionic circle (ἐξ 43, 44), not to speak of the fact that all of his
plays were taken withmere or less exactness from Greek eomedies.
