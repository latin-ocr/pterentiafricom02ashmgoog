well as other youths of the noblest families3 while older men, of lit
erary attainments and official rank, such as Sulpicius Gallus, Q. Fabius
Labeo, and Μ. Popilius, were not exelnded.¹ It was men of this class Ὗ
and character that Terence especially endeavoured to please with his l
comedies. To the general public he seems to have been indifferent
He even held himself aloof from the guild of poete? Otherwise itis

hardly possible that he should‘have been entirely unknown to Caecilius ’
at the time when, at the bidding of the Aediles, to whom he had taken

his play entitled th'e Andria for acceptante, he visited the aged poet

for the purpose of submitting to him the first result of his liter-ary

and artistic endeavours. He found Caecilius at dinner, and being a 3
stranger and somewhat meanly clad he was inrited to read from astaol ¹

reclining. After reciting a few verses, however, he was summoned by
Caecilius to a plaeeon the festal conch, and invited to share the deli-

cacies of the table. The recitation was then concluded amid much .
applause. The story, though a pretty one, is thought by Sellar to be ¹
apocryphal.⁸ Chronologieal consideratione also throw doubt on it; for i
if, as Jerome tells us, Caecilius died in 168 Β. a, we must assume that ¹
the meeting with Terence took place two years before the Andria
appeared on the stage. Yet the Eusebiae Chroniele gives the sub l
stanes of the tale, and Jerome’s statement regarding the death of
Caecilius may be incorrect⁴ Moreover it is not impossible that the J
event described in the narrative may have taken place two years before y

' Terence’s play was actually “brought ont.”

members of the literary and aristocratia party at Rome, he was able to
