wards proved to be, when the cultivation oi letters, and in* particular

· the stndy ol Terence, became fashionable in the time oi Cicero. ’ Then

it was that Terence’s purity of style was best appreciated3 indeed so
greatly was it admired that the poet was placed by critics of the
Augustan age on alevel with the polished writers of the day. Terence
had done much to promote the growth and refinement oi the colloquial
Latin speech. The language which he received from Plautus he im-
proved aud rendered more artistic by shaping it carefully to the
graceful rhythm and diction of the Greek dramatists, notably Menander.
This is his great gift to Roman literature, and it is the more note
worthy as coming from a man who flourished half a century before
Cicero was born, aud who accomplished his purpose, not through the
medium of a great epic like that of Vergil or Dante, nor by means cf

the name of Cicero or of Thucydides, but in connection with a species
of popular amusement which was associated in the public mind with
everything light and irivolous, and was in fact a mere accessory to an
established 'form of entertaiument in itself oi far greater magnitude

references to the poet and quotations from his plays which appear in
the grean orator’s speeches, essays and letters.l But Cicero's most

“ Tu quoque, qui solus lecto sermone, Terenti,
conuersum expressumque Latina uoce Menandrum
lu medium nobis sedatis motibus effers,
Quiddam come loquens atque omnia dulcia dicens,’' -·

and Caesar is quoted by Suetonius as expressing hi's appreciation ol ·
Terence's purity of diction : -

‘⁶ Tu qnoque, tu iu summis, ο dimidiate Menander, ,
’ Faueria, emerito, puri sermonis amator.”

Even Quintilian (10. 1. 99) makes use oi the word atayamissc'mu
in speaking oi Terence's plays, though that critic's general estimate
