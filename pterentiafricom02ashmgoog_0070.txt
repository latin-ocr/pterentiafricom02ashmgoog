INTRODUOTION 55

The musio of all of Terence's plays was composed by a slave named
Flaccus, who, with his master, Claudianis mentioned in the didascalice.
It appears that musiciens oi that time were generally slaves, and that
the plays of Plautus ¹also were probably iurniehed with musio, not by
the poet, but by these artists oi low degree. The extreme simplieity
oi the music is apparent when we consider tlrat it wae rendered by
one, or at most two musiciens (tibicinae) who played upon the tibia or
“duta” This word would perhaps be translated more accurately by
“ olarinet '² or “ oboe,'' since this instrument resemblee the lidia more
nearly than the modern flute does. There were generally two tiliae,
thetis, two pipes which were played upon at the same time by means
oi a sort oi double mouth-piace. This the musinian held between his
lips with the aid of a bandage (capessam) having hales init. By means
of these heles the two mouth-pisces were kept in place, the bandage
having been passed over the performer's mouth. The didascaliae pre·
fired to the several plays mention tibiae pares¹ (which included the
serranae as well as the dnae destrae, the former being merely ehorter
than the latter), and libiae inpares. The pares were two straight
pipes of equnl length. The inpares were two pipes unequel in length,
the left (sinistra) being the longer, and curved at the end. The right
(derare) was perhaps the same ae in the dnae destrae. Two leithand
pipes (dnae sinistrae) are nowhere mentioned in the didascalice. See
Howard‚ l. e. p. 43 ff.

86. According to Servius (ad Aen. ix. 615), the tibiae inpares were
called Phrygiam, while Donatus (Praef. to the Ad.) indicates that the
desae destrae tibiae (which were pares) were the same as the Lydian.
Thnt a change oi instrumente was possible in the course of a playis
evident from the word, primm tibiis inparibus deinde duabus destris,
which appear in the didascalia to the Henaton timornmenos. As in
the oase of emodern play or opera, a musical prelude preceded the
performance, end musical interludes were sometimes inserted between
the seenes (or acts).² See i 57.

¹ It is probable that the varieties were three in number; see A. A. Howard au

the Διἰλός or Tibia, in Harvard Stadios in Olass. Phil, rol. iv (1893), p. 42. .
