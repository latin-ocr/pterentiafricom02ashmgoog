parents. The children oi such parents were often sold into foreign
lande, and itis easy ιο conceive how Terence, if born at Carthago
under these or similar circumstances, may bave been sold by a elave-
dealer to Lucanus at Rome. Some such explanation of his origin and
deportation ιο Rome is justified in part by his cognomen Afer, which
points to his having been oi other than Phoenician blood. Had be
been of Phoenician origin, the last oi bis three names would more
naturally have been Poenulus, since the Carthaginians were com-
monly distinguished from the Africallu, and it was customary in giv-
ing names to slaves ιο indicate the nation to which they belonged.¹
On receiving his freedom Terence would naturally have added ιο his
praenomen Publius (the origin of which is unknown), the gentile name
of his master, which would then become his nomen, while as a sumame
he might retain the title of “ the African ” ae a mark oi peculiar dis·

person, and oi dark complexion,’'-physical characteristica not nn·
common among the Libyphoenicians. Undonbtedly his personal attrac-
tione and intellectual giftr, which had been the occasion of his obtain·
ing his freedom, were the cause also oi his permanent reception within
the aristocratic circle of younger literary men at Rome, to whom hs
had become partly known while he was still a member of hir master’s
household. This circle included many oi the nobility, ιο whom chiefly
at that time was owing the introduction into Roman life of Greek
culture and refinement; for it was the patrician, rather than the ple·
beian, who assumed the task of Helleniaing society, and making Greek
¹ literature a joy forever to the Roman consciousness.

44. Among the youths uf noble birth who were friends of Terence
and members, of the liter-ary coterie of which we bave been speaking
was Scipio Africanus the younger. He it was who gave his name to
what has since been known aethe Scipionic circle ci litterati,-a
relatively small community of persons who made Greek literature their
special study, and Greek retirement and education their standard. Το
this little group belonged also Gaius Laelius and L. Furius Philus, as
