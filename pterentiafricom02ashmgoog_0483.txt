Chremes cernes out of his house, accompanied by Clitipho, who has been ¹
discovered by his father to be on intimate termo with Bacchis (Clinia's rc·
puted sweetheart). This apparent treachery on Clitipho's part ls the ecca·
elon ei Chremes’ indignation expressed in 562, and bids fair to reveal the
truth which Syrus is anxious to keep secret. Accordingly Syrus comes te
the reseue, unites with Chremes in rebulring Clitipho, and succeeds ln χ
having the latter removed from the scene of aetion (596). Syrus then ex·
plains to Chremes his plau to cheat Menedemus-a plan really intended te
obtain money ior Clitipho
