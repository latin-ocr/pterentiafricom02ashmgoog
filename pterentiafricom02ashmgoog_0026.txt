INTRODUCTION 11

, the later Roman satura is ιο be referred, in its origin, not to the dra·
matio saturae, but ιο the genius 01 Lucilius (about 180-103 n. 0.), who
accordingly has been styled the father 01 Roman satire. Lucilius has
, been credited with the first attempt to add to the personal and serious
elementa in the medleys 01 Ennius that character of invective which,
in a more or less modified form, is repeated in the satires 01 his Roman
successors, and appears ιο have been ever since regarded as the distin·
guishing feature ο1 this particular branch of literary composition.

18. It remains ιο say a word about the mime and the Atellan 11111,
which, as has been observed (ξ 14), though not Latin in origin, were
nevertheless, like the suturae and the Fescennine verses, wholly inde·
pendent‚ in their beginnings, 01 the drama 01 the Atheniens. The
Mimas, a name given ιο the actor as well as ιο the piece, was at first
apantomimic farce, representing low life3 but at the end of the Re·
publican period it had secured a place in literature. It was introduced
into Rome from the Greek colonies in southern Italy, where in its
purely Greek 101111 it consisted of a single humorous scene or per-
sonality. Among the Romans it gradually cnlarged its subject-matter

until, under the Empire, it had absorbed materiale drawn from nearly .
all the earlier kinds ο1 comedy. During the flourishing period 01 Roman

comedy the 11111111 was frequently employed asan 1111111111, or after-play,
and was remarkable 101· 1ι1- obscene character and general scurrility
(Mart iii. 86, roccamaura mimis improbioro ,¹ Ov- Trc‘ct. 1491,
mimos obsceno 1011111111). Among the various writers 01 mimes the
most distinguished were Decius Laberius (105-43 Β. 0.), who 11 111111-
tioned by Horace (Sat. 1.10. 6), and Publilius Syrus, whose poemata
were listened to by Cicero on the occasion 01 1 dramatic contest at the
gamos of Oaesar (Cic. ad Fam. 12. 18. 2).

19. The Atellanae (sc. fabulae) were an improved kind 01 acturae.
'lhey took their name from Atella, a town 01 the Oscans in Campania,
where they are said to have originated,.¹ and whence they found their
way to Rome about 200 Β. 0., Campania having been previously brought
under Roman sway and influence. At Rome they were rendered by
, amateurs, usually young men 01 patrician familias, who spoke in Latin,
and who, unlike the performers 01 mimes, were required ιο wear masks.
