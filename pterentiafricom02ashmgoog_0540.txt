The scene represents a street in Athens, leading, on the sparsura right,
to the marketplace (swam), ou the 1515 to the harbour.¹ At the back oi the
stage stand the bouses oi Chremes, Demipho, and Dorio, in the order named,
beginning ou the leit.

Dauos enters from the right, bearing ssmall bag 51 money which repre·
sents the balance 51 an account held by Dauos to the credit oi Geta, his

iellow slave. 'ibe latter has selred Dauosto collect it and close the account,
ἵ since heis ln need oi the money ior a special purpose. The nature 51 this
purpose is the subject oi Dauos’ speculatione. Dauosisarpiomr epavescatis,
i. e. a character employed merely to introduce tbe play, and assist in the
explanation 51 555 plot. He appears only in the 5515555 or that part 51 555
play which precedes the action proper, 1515555. Hence he disappears ior·
ever at vs. 152. 01 like nature are Sosia in 555 Andria and Philotis in tbe
Hecyra, and Grumio in the Mostellcota 51 Ρ155555. Cf. introductory note to

55. ambus summus: on Aac. ato. populeris, “fellovcitiaen,”
“iellow-townsman.” 'ibis is 555 meaning ln 1155. 1031 and Ad. 155, 555
only other places in Ter. where the word is found. The rendering ‘⁶ follow·
countryman,” which rests on 555 kindred nationality oi the Daci and Getae
(Dauos, i. e. Deum =Dacus), is less likely to be correct. Though tire slave
was not technicallya citizen, yet hs might speak oi himself as such,
euphemistloally; especially as it was 555 custom 51 slaves ostento identiiy
themselves with their masters. Some commentatore taire the word in the
sense 51 “ fellow,'' “comrade’' ‘⁸ ehum’'

balance on his little account.’' The diminutives lend a pathetic colouring ,

Ter. See Lachmann on Lucr. V. 519.

88. musonem: sc. orauit.

month's dole, at the cost oi his very liis.'' 5555555555 was the measure 51
iood or ratione which the slave received each mouth ior his own sustsnance.
According 5ο Ρ1555. Stich. oo, the apportionment was made on the Kalends,
