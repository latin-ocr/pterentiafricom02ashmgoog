ANDRIA 3

tacta i=sccto primos i, e. it was the firstoi the poet's playsto be brought
out or exhibited, aud this happened when M. Marcellus and O. Sulpicius were
consuls, iu 166 a. o. Less probably, sactu I refers ιο the order oi composi·
ti0n; see the Teuffel-Schwabe Hist. ο] Rom. ιιι. vol. 1, S 109. 5 (Warr's
, translation). li so, it is not'to he immediately connected with the names oi
the consuls, since the latter are intended ιο indicate the year lu which the
play was performed. See Spengel’s Andria, ad edition, Introd p. viil.
It is probable that the pisy was composcd and presented ιο the aediles two
years, at least, prior ιο its performanoe.

Short metrical summaries oi the plote oi the plays are found in the MSS. ς
in the Bembine these are called pcrs'ocbce (εερωχιι), in the other codices
argumento. They are composed in the metre known as the lambio senarius,
and have, each, twclve verses; but their prosody ls loose, and their diction,
though in evident imitation of the style oi Terence, is often quite mechani-
cal, aud far removed from any resemblance ιο classioal Latinity. Since the
prologues to Terence's plays, however, have little or nothing to do with
the piot, these summaries are not altogether without their appropriate char· ·
aeter. They were not written by Terence, but by Gaius Sulpicius Apol-
linaris oi Carthage, who is frequently mentioned ln the Noctes Atticos oi
Aulus Gellius. The latterhad been his pupil, and refersto himasua'ra'a nostra
memoracprccter ulios doctce Apollinaris was the teacheraleo oi theEmperor
Pertinax, end the author of the summaries of the books oi the 'Aeneid end
perhapsof thenon-acrostic Argumentsto Plautus. He was oneof the learned
pedants who, in the second century aiter christ, devoted themselves to the
etudy oi the older Latin literatum it was evidently his alm ιο revive as
iar as possible the language and style oi the comio poete.

1. sororem, eto: cf. Illuc Per. 1. meretriculae: i. e. Chrysis, the
daughter oi the Andrian citizen to whom Phania, the brother oi Chremes,
had attached hhnseli as client, and who on Phania’e death adopted Pasibula,
the daughter oi Chremes, changing her name ιο Glycerium. The diminu-
tive occurs again in Hecut. Per. 10, aud Hec. Per. 4, and also ln Plautus,
but nowhere in Terence himself.

a. dat fldem, ete: cf. Aa. Per. il.

h namque ssiam: thus Umpf., Meis, Da, Tleclr. The Mes have
corn oliam, presenting an uncertain hiatus

5. gnatam: i. e. Philumena, another daughter oi Chremes, born since
the loss of Pasibula. The form is in imitation of Terence's use oi pactus
(older form of actus) as substantive; the pure participle appears in the
tiss, without exception, as uotae, autc. Hence actum in vs. 9.
