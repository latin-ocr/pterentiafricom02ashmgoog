accentual iornns, was felt ιο be too rude and too lacking in variety oi
movement to serve the purposes of the dramatic poets. It wa's not ill
suited ιο narrative poetry‚ and was used by Naevius in his poem on ¹
tha first Punic war, as well as by Livius Andronicus in his translation
oi the Odyssey. But Plautus, Caecilius, Terence and the rest turned
ιο the quantitative mensures of the Greeks to supply their needs, and
found what they required in the N ew Comedy which had furnished
them with their originals. Notwithstanding this, Latin prosody in the
time of Plautus and Terence was not yet fixed, aud what would have
been violation of mctrical law in the Augustan age was often plainly
permissibls in the earlier period. Metrical variety is far more conspic- l
uous in Plautus than in Terence. In the latter it is reduced, as one
might say, ιο a minimum, so iar at least as may be consistent with the
avoidance of monotony‚ the matres being practically resolvable into
two classes, the Iambic and Trochaic. The more elaborate matres,
such as the Dactylic, Cretic, Bacchiac and (perhaps) Choriambic, ¹
appear very seldom in Terence. Indeed those instances that do occur
aare confined ιο a single play, the Andria, unless verses 611-613 of

the Adclpboe arc correctly regarded as choriambic.¹ i

mus (petterned after the Greek Iambic Trimeter Acatalectic). It is

the ordinary metra of the dialogus, and at least one half cf the verses

in each oi Terence’s plays belongs to this measure. It is the opening
metra in all the plays. The scheme is ε
