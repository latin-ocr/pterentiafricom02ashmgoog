INTRODUOTION 41

teristic oi comedy, and this division is regularly found in all the man·
nscripts of the two Roman cornia poets, the hesdinge prefixed to each
scene giving the names cf the interlocutors lor that mene. There was
no necessary interruption oi the action at these points, however, the
distinguishing mark¹ of a new scene being merely the exit or ennacos
ol one or more chnrcders. But even the exit of one or more person·
ages oi the dram was not sufficient to create a new wenc, technioally
speaking,if the subsequent dialogus or solilcquy consisted oi but a
very iew verses. In that event the entrance ol another character was
required before the new scene was regarded as barium begnn.

63. In the Old Attic Comcdy the numana or Acrone employed
in a single mama was limited to three, the regular number lor tragedy.⁵
But in the N ew (lomedy‚ after the chorus was abalisbed, this number
was often exceedcd. At Rome the palliatae were still less restricted
in tbe number oi their personages. Supemumeraries, or mute charac-
ters, were ireely employed at all times, whether on the Greek or
Roman stage. The number oi speaking characters in Roman comedy
could seldom bave been less tltsn four, ior of tbe emant plays of
Plautus two only, the Cistellaria and Stichus, are capable ol being
represented by three cotors. The Captivi, Epidicus, Mercator and
Pseudolus require four performers. Ten other plays ol Plautus used
at least five, the Paoaulra and liudem not less than six; Ritschl con·
jectures that seven were needed in the Tricammus. In Terence, five
actore are required in the Heauton timorumaaos and the Hecyra, six
in the Adclploe and Phormio, and for the Andria and the Eunuchus
even this number is not sufficient.⁸

64. The fact that sorores nr Rana wsas usuam snavns seems
strange to modern ideas, but the actor (histria) and his art were
locked down on by the Romans, and the histrionia profession was
seldom taken up by a person oi free birth, -thougb freedmen were
often engaged in theatrica] enterprises and appeared before the public
