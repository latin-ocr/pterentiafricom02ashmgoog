01 scenos 1 and 2) 11 10 render it unnecessary 101 the poet to outline the plot

in the prologue. To illl tha lacuna which he suspected aiter this va 2

acu 1., 1111, au sm. “

28. Da. rightly assumes that Storax isan 1110111101 01 Aeschinus, and
that he does not come when called. 'ihc name does not appear iu the
titulat hesding prefixed to the scene in the MSS.

83. The vs. is corrupt according to Dz. (see his Adra. erle). Kauer,
however, reads asin the text, though he favours the substitution 01 hac-
11111 101 amare in 32, with deletion 01 the eat in that vs.; see his crit n

84. Wantiug in Δ and bracketed by Umpf. and Da, bnt accepted by
Spengel, Fleck, Kauer, Fabia, Psichari, and Stampini; see Kauers crit n.
Some editors place the commeat esee instead 01 soli, taking soli with sihi ς
against this see Engelbrecht, Stud. Terent, p. 31.

51. Most MSS. have aut 11111111, and vs. bb concluding with patrem.

81-3. The reading (given in the text) 01 the MSS. seems forced, and is

probably corrupt, esp. as siet is out oi place in· Ter. 11 the commencement ¹

01 1 vs. Ritschl’s excellent emendation (Proley. in Tria. p. 120 n.) has

been accepted *by Da, except that, in place 01 sein 1111, Dz. reads aciei, a .
conjecture of Conradt (Herm. x. 1011.) Da. (1881) scies. Kaucr stands by ,

the MSS.. but places au interrogation point aiter siet and drops the comma
11111 me. Thus he avoids the necessity of taking uli as: quaudo. But his
meaning seems to me to be inferior. For siet see his crit. n. ,

81, On the form disaiyacuit accepted by Dz. (1884) see explanatory n. in
my separate ed. 01 the Adelphos. Dz. (1881) gives designauit, the only form
known to Don, but Kauer argues 11 length in favour of 1111911011-
rightly.

191-2. Kauer prints scomma and then id (from A) aiter eruisti, omits tha
colon 11 the eud of the vs., and makes the words iu parenthesis 1111110 id
urgenti 10111011 dubitur-rightly. See his crit. u.

206. occeperis: the text 01 Don. alfords 1 choice bet. ocoep. and impe
incipio is intrans. elsewhere in Ter, 01 11 followed only by au acc. 01 aneut.
pron. (Dz.); but occeperis is supported by the parallel passage in And. vs,
quamtum occipit, and by Plaut. eope. 88 iric 0111111 cacatum 11110.

223-4. quasi . . . obsequere: 101 another explanation 01 these words, ¹

see crit. 11. in my ed. 01 the Adelplwe, cited above.
272. rem (Bentley) obviates the necessity oi making redisse impera.

aiv. I have inserted i before iutro, as Da, Fleck, Plessis, and Fabia have κ
done, for the sake 01 the sense, although against the MSS. and Donatus. i
289. Most MSS. (not Α) assign modo . . . primulum 10 Sostrata; thus ¹
also Dz. (1881), Spengel, Fleck. The asyndeton favonrs this distribution.
