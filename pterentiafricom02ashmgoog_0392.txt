benefici: not dependent on aarum so much es on ecprohratia which, in
good Latin, is followed by adat. of the pers. aud agen. of the thing—the lat-
ter corresponding tu the aee. of the thing after rememora see previous n.,
and cf. Livy, 23. 35. ’1 praeceperat ae qao eaprohrota'o cuiquem ceteris sor-
taaae discordiam inter ordiner sereret, where fortunae and cuiquam are
separatcly dependent on amouere. Transi, “is like the reproaching an
ingrate on account of a benedt (conferred upon him).'’ benefici is placed
where it ean be felt slightly also with commmorett’o. The genitive ending
in a single i is the regular inflection for all nouns in -iaa, dam, in the older
Latin.

the india in questions; e. g. Haut. 832 qaia accipis (⁶⁴ why not take iti'')
is ineffectaoommand. 80899. ln And. 849 responde of the MSS. is changed
to rependes hy some good editors, who follow Don. qnid est: questions
apparently dependant frequently have the indic. in Plaut. and Ter. Strictly
speaking, such questions are independent; aa in English, when we say ‘tell
nte, where are you going i' instead of ‘tell me where you are going.' This
is called parataxis Cf. 449, 849, 818, etc. The indic. occurs most frequently
after such expletives aa dic mihi, loquere, ceria responde, expedi, aomo, uide,
rogo, uolo reirascar sciara uiden, oudin, acia, and the like. The tendency to
paratactic arrangement of the members oi a sentence predominated in early
Latin speech, as also in the early Greek, and is natural to colloquial lan-
guage at all times. Cf. Ε. Becker. de tyrtaei interrog. ohiip. in Studemund's
Studien, p 115 :Ussing's note on Plaut. Amph. Prol. 1⁷3 Roby,1761. qnod

hardly more definite than adamantes. Cf. Ean. 824, and Hor. epae 2. i.
