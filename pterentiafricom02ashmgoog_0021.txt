as wellas a nephew of Alexis, the poet of the Middle Comedy. His l
environme'nt and associatione were accordingly favourable ιο the derel·
opment of his literary testes, and like Terence he began to produce
plays at an early age. Like Terence also, he is said to have written a y
goodly number of comedies, no less than one hundred and eight being
attributed to him. Uniortunately but few extensive fragments of these l
heve come down ιο modern times; and yet these fragments are impor-

the contrary, they were conspicuous in their writings for the care with
which they kept within the bounds of what was then considered to be
