CODICES AND ΤΕΧΤ OF Tharnen

- 98. The sources from which the text of Terence is derived are the
manuscripts, the quotations of ancient writers, the commentarios of
grammarians, and the conjectures of modern scholare.

The principal manuscripts of Terence, together with their letters
of reference, by which they are commonly designated, are given
below:

(A) Corax Echemus, so called from its former owner, Bernardo
Bembo, who lived from 1433 to 1519 of the Christian era. This MS.
came into the possession of lirrlvius Ursini, who bequeathed it to the
Vatican hbrary, where it now lies, its number being 3226. Itis of the ³
fourth or fifth century and is written in rustic capitale. No other MS. '

· of Terenceie its cqual in point of age or importante. Yet it is not in
a good state of preservation. The Andria is wholly wanting ae far as v
verse 786, and of lines 787-887 only a few letters survive. Of Adel·
pace 914-997 only a very small portion can be accurately deciphered,
and of the Phormio verses 172, 240-2‚ and 635 are lost. But not—
withstanding its mutilated condition, the Bembine is our most trust· l
worthy authority in determining the Terentiau text, for it is the only
MS. certainly free from the arbitrary alterations of Calliopius. All
other codices are now believed to be descended from acommon ancestor
whose text underwent revision at the hands of this unknown gramma-
rian or critic. When Calliopius lived is uncertain. He is assigned by
some authorities to the fifth century; by others he is thought to have
lived as early as the third. It is probable‚ at least, that he flourished
before the time of Aelius Donatus, whose commentery on Terence has
come down to us, and who lived in the middle of the fourth century
n. ο. In the Codex Bembiouc the plays appear in the following
order: Andria, Eunuchos, Heauton ticwrumccoa wamio, Hecyra,
Adelphoe.

99. The manuscripts of Terence (except A) are written in minus-
cule characters, and may be separated into three groups according to
their hinship and supposed merit. These groups are herein designated

as Ι, ΙΙ, ΙΙΙ. Under Ι and II fall those MSS. which are capable of
classification in accordance with their kinship to one another. Under
