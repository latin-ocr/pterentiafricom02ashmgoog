were more or less on the old Greek model. An exception to this rule
was the beautiful theatra oi Herodes Atticus, a wealthy Greek oi the
time of Hadrian, which was erected on the western side of the south·
ern slope ol the Acropolis at Athens, and had a semicirculus· orchestra.
Extensive remeius of this theatra still exist and exhibit a mixture
ol Greek with Roman architecture.¹ The almost total disappearance
of the chorus in the New Comedy accounts not only ior its absence
in general from the comedy of the Romans, but also ior the dimin·
ished size of the Roman orchestra, and iu part for the greater mag·
nitude of the Roman stage, for which the larger number of actors
in the Roman drama is also in a measure responsible. Moreover an
occasional chorus² appeared in the comedy of the Romans, like that of
the fishermen in the Rudeus of Plautus. For this, although it was
undoubtedly a reflection of the chorus in some Greek original, aplane
was made upon the stage, while the orchestra continued to serve merely
as a portion of the auditorium. There is uo suggestion of a chorus in
Terence.

the frouts of ordinary houses. There were usually three doors in the
scamna, two of which might belong to one house, as in the Adclplroc ,·
or each door might represent a separate house, as in the Andria. The
doors opeued ontwards upon the stage (proscaenium, pulpitum), but
not so as to disclose an interior; ior this no provision was made in
Roman comedy. Hence all conversations must take place iu the street,
or at the threshcld of the house-door. Nothing corresponding to
a change of scene, such as is common enough in a modern theatre,
was brought into operation before the first century Β. c. But among
the appartenances of the stage sccnery was the lane or narrow alley
(auqipomum, angiportus), which opened into the street, not at the side,
but at the rear of the stage. This occasionally served the actor as
a place of partia] concealment, asin Phormio, 891 f. At either eud
of the stage was an exit (or entrance). That on the right (ol the
spectatore) was supposed to lead to the iorum (ἀγορά) and the centre
