212 APPENDIX

partly because the vs. takes no account of the previous repetition of the
number ten, hut is constructed aa if the sum of ten minae were mentioned
now for the first time. Hauler however does well ιο adhere to the MSS,
esp. as lt would be very natural for the speaker to endeavour to make his
number appear smaller, by omitting reference to what had gone before.
lloreover there is nothing ιο show theta vs. of Terence may not conclude
with two lembi. cf. Hauler¹s crit. n.

710. Da. supposese lacuna to exist before qnee; not so Hauler end Fleck.

lto. audiemus, the conjecture of Bentley, is e less fortunate emendation
for medies of the Mus. than audietis, the reading of De. (following Weise
and Wagner) and cf Fleck. The 2nd pers. pl. will include Phanium, who
leentitlcd to be informed of what has taken place, end who can be found
only within the house. cf. n. in the Dz.·Heuler ed. ‚

808. homo : retained by Fleck„ rightly. See explanatory note.

818. id is retained by Fleck, but may well be rejected, since potnit is
¹quite impersonal; cf. 803, Heeet. eil, Aa. 568, and the common expression
pannium potest.

eat. Fleck. meeum, not rightly. See Hauler¹s note.

828. Bracketed by both De. and Hauler‚ but see the letters crit n.

863. Δ has reprehendit, which Da. rejects on metrical grounds, and for
the reason that with pone tha preflx is unnecessary. Ιοοιοοοοο of pone repr.
and the like are given by Hauler who reads pirre reprendit pellic in his text

- rightly. See his notes on this vs. The reading adprendit (adprehendit),
adopted by some editors, is supported hythe Calliopian recension and by

A⁸‚ and is ‘doubtless due to the fact that, when this recension was made,
adprehendere was the verb commonly used in thisccnnection' See M.
Warren in A. J. P. rol. iil. p. 483. ,

901. en uerebantur: Dz. has ert rademini ln deference to O. 1⁴¹. W.
Mueller (Pleni. Prot. p. ιιι) who would read rebcminin (without the en),
rejecting verebamini of A, on the ground that the second e cannot be short-
ened in Ter. This leads to the arbitrery substitution of me . . . secere for ·
ne . . . facerem of the MSS. The weakness of this position, which De. has
defended ln his crit. n. (see Dz.·Hauler ed), ls exposed by Klotz (inerit, y
pp. 88-89) whom Hauler and Elmer follow. Hauler has en nereiernini ;
but en is not in A, end filmer does well, perhaps, in rejecting lt. Fleck.
has followed De.

905, All the MSS. have this vs. here, but the vs. is clearly out of place. i
It should come after 895, snd ιο that point Fleck. and Dz. have transferred ¹
lt. See De. (Adra. Urit).

913. nune uiduam extrudi: thus Umpf. and Da, supported oyBcDP.
But Hauler and Elmer follow A -rightly perhaps, since uiduam may be a
gloss upon earn nere. See footnote.
