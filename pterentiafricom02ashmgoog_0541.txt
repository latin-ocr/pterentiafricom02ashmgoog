iorts. A man's ysaiae was conceived to be a sort oi attendant spirit asso-
ciated with his liie from the oradle to the grave. It was divine, but not
immortal, and its character and moods were identified with those oi the
man himself. Perhaps the nearest English parallel is the word ‘sonl’ as
used in the parable oi the rich man (St. Luke xii. to), ‘I will say to my soul,
Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat,

Geta appears irom the house oi Demipho. ln the conversation that ensuee
between the slaves the situation is unfolded. Chremes and Demipho, two
old men and brothers, have leit theirrespective sons, Phaedria and Antipho,
in charge of Geta, during their absence in iar countries. Chremes has gone l
to Lemnos, Demipho to cilicia. Geta, who belongs to the iamlly ol Demi· ’
pho, has tried todo hia duty by his old master, and to keep the young men ,
within reasonable bounds. For this he has received harsh treatment at their
hands, has given up the task in consequence, and is now bent on aiding
them as much as possible even in their iollies. Phaedria has fallen in love
with a music-girl belonging to a certain slave-merchant oi the town, whose
name is Dorio. Antipho has become enamoured oi a young woman named
Phanium, wh0, he bas reason to believe, isan Athenian citizen. Througlr
the assistance oi the parasite, Phormio, he has been enabled to marry her,
and is now iu dread oi his fathers displeasure. In thls dread Geta ahares, l
