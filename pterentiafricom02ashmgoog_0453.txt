Vs 956 might heve brought the play 10 1 close, were it not' 101 the cvi-
dent propriety 01 doing justice to the characters 01 the under plot, Charinus
and Philumena. As Donatus says, it would be uniair to leave Philumena
without 1 husband. Accordingly Pamphilus is no sooner 1411 alone on the
stage than Charinus appears and listens to his soliloquy and to his subse-
quent conversation with Dauos. Having learned the truth, Charinus elicits
from Pamphilus 1 promise to plead his cause with Chremes. Hence Pam-
philus leads the way int-o the house insearch 01 Chremes, and Dauos informs
1114 1114141104 that whatever else is to bc done will take place within.
