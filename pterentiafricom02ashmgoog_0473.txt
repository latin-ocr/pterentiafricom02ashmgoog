Syrus and Dromo arrive from Athens, the women being not iar behind.
'l'he slaves arc in conversation, as they enter the stage by the door on the
spectator's right. Their talk is overheard by Clinia aud Clitipho, who are
not aware that Syrus has brought with him Bacchis also and all her train.
Bacchis is Clitipho’s mistress. Clinia mistakes the remarks of Syrus about
Bacchis as though they referred to Antiphila, and is much distressed in
consequence. Syrus reassures him, however, eud outlines a plan to pass
off Bacchis aa Clinia's mistress, and to antrust Antiphila to the keeping of
Clitipho's mother—an arrangement finally accepted hy the young men.
