INTRODUCTION 29
were written, in part at least, hy his noble friends. The report thus

spread abroad was widely credited in antiquity, and suspicion was

strengthened by the fact that Terence declined either ιο confirm or to
refute it. Probably the charge, though exaggerated and vicinus, was
not without foundation ; but to make an explanation would have been
to incur the risle of giving offence to men whose friendrhip he could
not afford tolose. The truth appears ιο be that Terence read his com-
positione aloud in the circle of his literaryfriende, and avalled himself,
independently and according to his choice, ol their criticisms and sug·
gestione. Such assistance would partly accouru for the elegance and
purity of his style and language, - qualities which, even considering
his great advantages and constant intercourse with the highest and
most refined society of his time, appear ιο be most miraculous in view
of his. immature years and foreign extraction.

46. Terence's literary activity displayed itseli wholly in the pro·
duction of palliatae (ὅ 24), to which the tendeney ol the times as well
ae his own leanings, prompted him. After bringing out six comedies,
between 166 and 160 Β. c, hc went ιο Graece, probably for the pnr-
pose of studying Greek life and institutione, which it was his habit ιο
portmy in his comedies. In 159 Β. c. he died, just as he was about
to return ιο Rome with translations, which he had made in Greeoe, of
anumber of Menander’s plays. Acoounts vary as to the place and
manner of¹ his death. One story relates that he was lost at sea off the
island of leucas while on his way ιο Italy, and that his trande-
tions perishcd with him. Another account declares that he died at
Stymphalns in Arcadia after having lost his baggage and manuscripts
through shipwreck.

47. The six comedies written and exhibited at Rome by Terence
have been transmitted ιο us. The following enumeration gives them
in the supposed order of their publio presentation (i 74) during the
lifetime of the poet, according to the evidence afforded by the
didascalice and by Donatus. —
ln 166 Β. a: The Andria· at the ludi Megalenses.

In 165 Β. c. ε The Hecyra· at the tadi Megalenses (an attempted pre-
sentation which proved a failure).
ln 163 Β. a: The Hamae timoratam at the ladi Megalenses.
