tha words 10 150 nurse (ci. Kauer's crit. 0.) - with less propdety.

291. Spengel happily 00010000 thewordsroloa . . . odeat in aparenthesis.

297. ingenio: thus Umpi., Wagner, Da, Fleck, on the assumption that
Ter. would not bave written genere in such close proximity to familia.
But Spengel accepts the MSS. reading- rightly.

392. ae is the reading oi A and L, 01 Da.. Kauer, Stampini, and Fleck.
It is omitted by Umpi. and Spengel.

318. Probably an interpolation. At best the vs. is unsatisfactory in
meaning and ean only with difficulty be forced into correspondence with
what precedes and follows. meo modo: thus Bothe, Fleck. (1857), and
Umpr. meo is not in the MSS.; it is notin Tyrrell, Da, or Kauer, yet it
greatly helps both the metro and the meaning oi a doubtful verse.

325, quio sit: Da. finds the subj. bere opposed 10 150 common usage of
early Latin, and reads qaid fit; Fleok. gives quid-manat. But 'Kauer
rightly justifies quid ait on the ground that it takes up and repente Geta’s

380. Tha name Staptoato is omitted from 150 scene-heading ln 1505188,
although it bas as much right there as that oi Dromo (376), whose name is
added to those of Demea and Syrus in A.

895. num: Klette (1110010. Terent. [Bona. 1855] p. 20 i).

524. I bave followed Fleck. in placing propert at the beginning oi va. 524.

528. in mentem: of. Heout. 986 and footnote. In acase thus doubtful
it is best to follow what appears to bave been the more common archaia
usage. Hence the acc. is adopted by most good editors. Of. Plaut. Amph.

of 15οΜ88. (except Α) and assumes 0100000 after this va. So also Wagner
