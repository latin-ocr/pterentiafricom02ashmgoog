and were copied from the dress oi ordinary life. They consisted oi a
tunic and a mande, the former being an under-garmcnt called by
the Greeks chiton (χιτών), the latter an ostergarment, called hythe
Romans palliam, a term corresponding to the Greek ἱμάτιον. As the
palliam was a long garment and enyeloped the entire figure, the short
chlamys (χλιιμύς) was often substituted ior it, especially hy soldiers
and young men. An account oi the dresses used in the New Comedy
is given by Pollux (iv. 119-120). From this it appears that the typi·
calor conventional character of the personages appearing on the stage
was emphasized through the dress. For example, the tunic oi the slave
was short, hut ior the froeborn it was long and had slceves. White rai·
ment usually distinguished old men. Yonng men wore crimson. Para·
sites were iu black or gray. The leno had a bright-coloured tunic, while
his mantlc was variegated. The cloak of the courtesan was generally
oi a saffron hue. Yonng women commordy were dressed in white, old
women in light blus or green. A distinguishing mark oi the old man
was his staff with a crooked handle. The rustic had a wellet and staff,
as well as a tunic of leather. The heiress wore a iringo to her dress.
In general the dress of the New Comedy resembled in many respecta
that of tragedy‚ but differed from the latter in being comparatively
plain and uuadorned. The dress oi the Old Comcdy was probably quite
different iram either-1 The N ew Comedy employed also slight sort of
shoe or slipper, which was not tied to the foot, and was the same for
all characters. It was called ἐμβάς, in Latin saccas, and was a dis-
tinguishiug feature oi comio attire, just as the cethaeam, or buskiu,
was characteristic oi the ‘make-up) of the tragedias.

67. As to the use of mus, it is quite certain tliat they were not
regularly adopted ior the palliatae until aiter the time oi Terence.
Yet iu the Greek New Comedy all the actore wore mocks, and wore

them invariably‚ as in the Old Comedy and in tragedy. The custom
was one from which the natural conservatism of the Greeks was
unable to depmt, however much the mask may have seemcd un·
necessary or even hurtful to the cause oi high art. In the New Comedy
the mask was really out oi place, for it concealed the usage, and shut
