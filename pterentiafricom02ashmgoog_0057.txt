42 INTRODUGTION

l

both ae actore and as managers of theatrical troupes. In the latter
capacity the freedman was called dominas yreyis,· if 'he was an
actor also, it was usually in the leading r'ole. The poet or playwright
was generally distinct from the manager audirem the actor. For
example, the plays of Terence were “managed’' for him by Lucius
Ambivius Turpio, who also acted in them3 but Livius Andronicus '
appears to have been his own manager, and, like Shakeepeere, to have
even acted in his own plays (see Livy, vii. 2 od ficar)

65. As the plays were usually performed at the publio gemes, tbe
gisors of the gemes, ludorum dolorm, were greatly concerned about
the success of the pieces presented on these occasions, and rewarded the
manager accordingly. The latter, too, was especially interested in

’ the same question, not only on account of the reward just mentioned,

but because he was obliged to assume the financial risk attending the
representation. The choice of a play rested with the dominus. He
made his bargain with the poet, purchasing from the latter such plays
as seemed likely to prove popular, and rejecting the rest. Thus the do-
minus became the intermediary between the poet aud the givers oi the
gamos, who, on deoiding to include dramatic entertainments among
the performances at the lodi, made their application to the theatrioal
manager, rather than to the poet himself. That the ludorum dotores,
however, had au occasional word to say in the selection of the plays
to be presented is probable. It is evident, therefore, that grem paine
were taken to insure the favourable reception of a play by the people.
The poet was encouraged by the manager3 the latter received his com·
pensation at the hands of the person who gave the public exhibition,
and the actors themselves, or so many of thern ae bad pleased the
audience, were accustomed to be entertained by the dominus at a ban·
quet especially provided for their benefit. cf. Plant. Eud. 1418 ff.
It is evident, moreover, from the closing words of the Cistellaria, that
the poorer actors (being slaves) were often severely punished. The
question, too, whether the dominus was also a contractor or purveyor
(conductor, choroque) whose business was to provide the theatrioal
company with its costumes and general stage outfit, has been decided
in the affirmative by Mommsen.l
