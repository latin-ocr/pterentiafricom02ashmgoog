84. The soenes of a comedy of Plautus or Terence may be ranged i
roughlyin two classes,— those which were said, and those which were i
rainy. The former were simply recited m a conversational tone and
were not accompanied by music. They were known as diuerbia (de- .
acidia), dialogum, and were invariably written in iambic senarii. The i
latter were known as caat ica (ἓ 61) Strictly speaking, the caat icam
was a lyrioal monologoe (μονῳδία) which was sung to the tune of the i
tibia, and accompanied by appropriate gestures or dancing. The ἱ
matres were mixed or irregular, to correspond to the varying emotions ¹
‘expressed Among them were such measures as the cretio, bacchiae,
trochaic octonarius and others of a drstrnctly lyric character. An
instance of this specics of caat icam occurs at verse 610 of the Adel-
place, where Aeschinus' rs the viatim of· considerable mental excitament.

A notable example occurs also at the opening of the fourth act of the
Andria. But the term canticam was used also in a wider sense, and
was made to include the, scenas which were merely declaimed or
chanted (with musical accompaniment), like the recitative of a modern
opera. The matres employed in the composition of these soenes were
the trochaic septenarius, the iambic septenarius, and the iambic octo-

, narius. The strictly lyrical cantica were not always sung hythe actor
himself, if we may believe Livy (7. 2. 8. ft), but by a young slave who
stood near the tibicen, while the actor confined himself to such action .
or gesticulation as suited the sentiment of the verses thus delivered.
The person who sang these lyrical portions of the play was probably
the same as the Oaator who came forward at the close of the drama
and challenged the applause of the audience in the word plaudite.1

MUSIC AND MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS

’ 85. We see in what has been said a decided difference between the
ancient and the modern practice. But we see also a resemblance to
a modern comic opera, the music being of course far less elaborate.i

² A brief bibliography of Greek music is given by Fairclough in his ed of the
Andria, p. lxix, note. There he cites Naumann's History of Mario, ed. by Sir F.
(lore Ouseley (Cascell ἀ Ga), and his own article on Tyrtaeus, etc, in A Librory

os tie World’s Best Literature, ed. by Charles Dudley Warner.
