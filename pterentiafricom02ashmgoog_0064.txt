74. While Greek plays were exhibited in honour oi Dionysm, in
a theatra dedicated to the god, and the representation, or series of
representatione, was the principal feature in the public worship ol that
particular divinity‚ Roman plays, on the contrary, bore no such impor-
tant religione significanco. They formed onlya part, and usually a
very small part, of the performanees at the public gemes. 'lhe play
was in fact a mere side-show at these great festivals, and there was
nothing in it suggestive of religion except (possibly) the altar. 'lherc
were four great festivals at Rome, —the ludi Rotnani, given by the
Currrle AEdiles in September in honour ol Jupiter3 the lardi Apolli·
nares, celebrated by the Praetor Urbanus in duly3 the ludi Pletoii,
given by the Plebeian AEdiles in November, and the Megalensia
(μεγάλη), or ludi Megalenses, held by the Curule AEdiles in the
mouth of April. The last were instituted· in commemoration oi the
introduction' into Rome, from Phrygia, in 204 n. c., ot the worship
of Cybele, who was honoured by the Romans aa the Great Mother,
or Mamur Mater [damst Other gemes also were given on certain

extraordinary occasions, such as the celebration ,oi a triumph, or ol
the lada‘ Saeculares, the dedication of a public building, or the funeral

of a distinguished man (ludi sitaebres or funeratos). Of them all, the
ludi limant, also called Magni or Maximi, were the oldest and the
most important, and it was et their celebratior that the first regular
theatrical exhibitione took place. Indeed it was not until sometime

had elapsed after the death of Livius Andronicus that any of the
other public gemes were embellished with the added ath-action of

dramatic performances. Among the latter were plays of Terence. .
