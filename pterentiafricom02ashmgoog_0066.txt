INTRODUCTION 51

metr-es is the spondae. But to introduce into tho verse a foot contain-
ing a number of aaaron, or uuits of time (ψ), greater than the number
properly belonging to the fundamental foot oi tho measure, would seem
to violate the theory of equivalents. The violation, however, is more
apparent than real, for the spondae, or othersubstituted foot, was ap-
proximately reduced to the time of the iambus or trochee by rapid
utterauee or slurring of the syllables, and so became the practical
equivalent of the principal foot of the measure. It was not, therefore,
the full spondae or dactyl of Vergil. 'Ibe spondae when substituted
for an iambus may be indicated by >.t, the dactyl by >va the ana·
paest by w L, the proceleusmatic by w d v· The regular casura of tho
iambic senarius is after the arsis or first syllable of tho third foot
(penthemimeral). But the verse admits caesura iu the fourth foot
<hephthemimeral). When this happens a secondary casura occurs
sometimes in the second foot, or else a diaeresis after that foot. Cre·
sura well defined, however, isby no rneans invariablc in Terence and
Plautus.

77. The Innaro Snrrnnnams (corresponding to the Greek Iambic
Tetrameter Catalectic) is more rarely used than the senarius. The
scheme is as follows: -

vlo-lvlv-lvlv-ivlvh

It consists of seven complete feet (hence its name), and a half foot.
The regular division of the verse is after the fourth foot (diaeresis);
hence hiatus and syllaba auceps ara permitted here; a caesura inthe
fifth foot is usual in case of the failure of the direresis. The fourth
foot is preferably a pure iambus. Otherwise the substitutions are the
same as in the senarius.

78. The Innarc Ocronnnrus (Greek lambio Tetrameter Acatalec-
tic) occurs very frequently in the matina. The scheme is:-

vlu-ivlu-{vle-ivlesc

It consists of eight full iambic feet. The break takes the form of
diaeresis at the end of the fourth foot, which in that case is treated
as the final foot oi the verse is treated, that is, it must be a pure iambus.
