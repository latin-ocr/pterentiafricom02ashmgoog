situation for the sake of making the first act end with this scene, lt being

assumed that the dividing line for a new act occurs only when the stage ls
empty. This rule however will not hold, as an examination oi the tert of
the plays will show. Nor should we expect it todo so, since the cornio
writers had uo thought of a regular division into ilve acts. See Introd. 557.
Asa scene is properly a subdivision of an act, it is inconsistent with this
theor'y to make au act conslst oi but a single scene. The only good reason
for doing so in this instance ls that the necatio ends at 171, and the plot
really begins to work in the next vs. But even this reason will not stand
as a hard and fast rule for other plays, iu which the repentio comes toan
end iu the first scene, and considerably before the commencemeut of the
second act. Accordingly Umpf., Fleck. and others, following Bentley,
mark the eud of the first act of the Andria et 300-rightly.

‘itt semper, according to Fairclough, should go with uerebor, for the
reason that there is no exact parallel ln Ter. to justiiy its use with a noun
having so slight averbal force as lenitus. But it is construed asin the com-
meutary, by Klotz, Wag., Meis. and other editors- rightly, forits position
in the sentence is really the decisive factor, of. oi νῦν (ἄνθρωποι), etc.

eoi-t I prefer (omitting sed) edico itti, ne temere fociae, the reading of
Fleck. and Fairclough. ne . . . swina, in that case, is dependent. edico

keeps, aud which perhaps is to be preferred, if the previous rte-cl. be de-
pendent, on the ground thet a prohibition with the pres. subj. is rarely
introduced by oeque (neo) (but rather by neue), unless u cl. with rte (pro-
hibitiva) certainly precedes lt-which in this case is at least doubtful; cf.
Elmer on The Latin Prohibits'oe in A. J. P. vol. xx. 3. But it is to be pre·
ferred also because (as a fut. indie. = au imperative) it suits the sense and
the context, whatever may be the constr. of the rte-cl. It is less polite than
the subi, and is not infrequcnt iu Terence.

205. neque tu haud: Don. I prefer oeque tu boc of the tiss. The

double neg, though easily accounted ior, is not needed, aud praedictum

213. It is well to reject aut, and thus avoid the awkwarduess oi such
a disjunctiou as perii out . . . dabit. Bentley's explanatiouthat perii is
interjectional is hardly satisfactory: “if he finds it out (ruini) or even
should it suit his whim, etc.'’ .

226. ut: rightly rejected also byFlecls. for the reason that monosyllabis
conjunctione and prepositions are rare at the end oi a vs, if in sense they
belong to what follows rather thau to what precedes. cf. however Spen-
gel's crit. note.

praed and aliquod? See his crit. n. on Ptorm. ite.
