4 NOTES

8. persuasu: serora, ii read, would be pronounced as a trisyllabis,

contrary to the usage of Plautus and Terence. “Pamphilus soorns not the ,

advice oi Dauos‚” and gets into trouble in consequence.

10. generum abdicet, ‘⁶ disclaims (rejects) him as son-in-law.''

11. filiam, “as his daughter.” adgnitum: arcbaic ior ορπὶιοοης ci.

ΡἘΒὸΟΝΑΕ

Persona was the word for a character in a play, and was first applied to
the actor's mask, through whose mouth-aperture the voice reached the ears
of the audience (per, sonore), greatly increased in volume; see Haigh,

Tira Atra Theatra, ad ed. p. 296 f. In tbe text oi most MSS. oi Terence, Δ

the personae are distinguished by the initial letters of their names, bnt in
the codices Bembinm aud Victorianus (in part) they are indicated by letters

oi the Greek alphabet. Of. n. on (lerator, 981. The lists oi pmcooae prefixed ι

. ιο the plays are not found intuentes, but are compiled from the hesdinge l
· to the different scenas. The order of the names corresponds ιο the order in ’
which they corne upon the stage, rather than, as in Sbakespeare's dramas, i
tothe relative importance oi the characters themselves. The names iu both r

Plautus and Terence are, in most cases, oi Greek origin, and are frequently

intended to suggest the disposition or some striking peculiarity of the char· ,
aeter represented. Tor example, in the Audito, the possible derivation oi r

Pamphilus (from rire-l- φιλέω), the name oi the ardent lover, is obvious, while

Glycerium, his betrothed, is suggestive of γλυκύς, “ sweet.” On this subject l
see Spengel’s Andeda, Introd. p. xiv, and Lorenz’s Most. pp. 2-33 compare ,
the custom oi the playwrights of the Eiizabethan period in England; see ,

also Sheridan (Setool sor aarum, and Thackeray.

PROLOGUS

The purpose oi the prologue in the New Comedy of Menander and his Χ

brother poete was to explain whatever the audience needed to know about

the play-its source, name, plot-and to bespeak for it the goodvvill oi y

the spectatore. In general it may be said that Plautus followed his models
ln this respect. But Terence departed from this enatem, His prologues are
simply short addresses which, though they give the name and tbe origin of

the play, and plead for a friendly and impartial bearing, are yet in no respect ι
concerned with the plot or contenta of the play itself. They are devoted r

chiefly to the criticism oi rivel poets and detractors, by whom Terence seems
