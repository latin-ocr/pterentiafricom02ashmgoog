2. id negoti, ‘⁴ 11111 simple taak ''; more restricted than id capotium. The
partitive gen. dependent on a neut. pron. (more commonly the interrog.
puid) 11 very frequent in Terence; cf. 250, 95& Heeut. 818; Eun. 546, utu,
633; Pham. 84& Her. 043. ·

3. quaa fxiaaet nnana, “whatever plays he should composa ''; for
schalae patefecisset. Another kind of attraction takes place when 11111010-
cedent keeps ite position before the rel, as in Plaut. Amph. 1009 Naucratem
quem reeueca're uolui, 111 101111111111. Usually the attracted word 11 the
subiect of tha sentence, though not always; cf. Plaut. capr. 110 11101 ee

5. prologis: from πρόλογος. ao we have oocadonally propino from προ·
riva, prepete from emeatus, etc. operam abutitur, “ uses up (exhauste)
his efforta” abuti (ὰπχρῆσθαι) before Cicero’s time meant “to use curn-
pietely ’'; afterwards it came to signify ‘⁴ to‚misuse,” in consequence of 111
association with the idea 01 miadirected 011011, or owing to its connection χ
with an adv., like 111011, percurre. From this it is but a step to the idea oi
abuse or outrage, without any modifying word or phrase, as in perteque '
abutere patientia rwatru (even here, however, we may render “uae up '').
abutor takes the acc. in Terence, 1101110111ωο111110110 1111101101, except
in Aa. 815. Sofruor is joined with the abl.. except possibly in Heaut. 401,

is written with tha aec. in Au. 811, 876, Phorm. 403, but with the abl. in
Phorm. 830. suaper governs the acc. everywhere, except, perhaps, in Aa.
0031111111 however some editors substitute tuom officium for tuo officio oi
the MSS. In Plautus the acc. 11 the'rule with suuper, and in general 11
