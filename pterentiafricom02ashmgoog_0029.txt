rounded plot and a dialogue carefully arranged, were enacted· in the
Latin tangue, andin the presence and for the special benefit of a
Roman audience. 'The particular occasion was the celebration of the
Lada· Rowaaai in the year after the close of the first Punic wai, whose
final struggle took place at sea near the Aegatian Islands in the year
241 Β. o. The production of the two plays referred to added greatly to
the interest of the gamas, and from that time onward the performance
of Latin plays, modelled on Greek originale, became a distinct and
regular feature of the Roman festivals. Ἴ

23. Both tragedy and comedy, then, at Rome were confessedly r
derived from Greek sources. Roman tragedy has wholly perished, — ¹
except a few fragments and the plays of Seneca, who wrote in the ¹
time of the Empire. But even Seneca's plays are occupied with Greek
subjecte, while the extant fragments and titles ol other and earlier
tragedias indicate that the piecer they represent were either founded
on Greek originale or elaborated from legende oi Greek poetry and
mythology. It is true that certain dramas of the nature of tragedy
dealt with Roman subjecte and hore the general impress of a rational
character; but even these sabama praetentae, as they were called, bor-
rowed their form and outline from Greek models‚ and the fact that
they have not been preserved would suggest that their popularity was
limited. Though tragedy suited well the Roman predilection for ora- i
tory and rhetoric, and was listened to at Rome for nearly two centn· Ϊ
ries, yet it never took root iu Italy as comedy did, and was in general
·of less consequence than the latter in popular esteenr. ’

24. The comedies which Livius Andronicus and other Roman writ-
ers adopted from the Greek were known as fabulae palliatae, from
the palliam. (ἱμάτιον), a Greek cloak worn by the actor. They were
called also owaoediae, as though no other form of comedy were con·
ceivable. Nevertheless there grew up at Romo, in the century after
Livius Andronicus,a species of comedy termed the fabula togata, a
designation intended to contrast with the name palliata, since the
subjecte treated were Roman instead of Greek, and the actors were
attired in the Roman toga. The more vulgar tone of these native
comedies, however, caused them to be known as tabernariae, “ slrop-
plays.'' Not one of them has survived to modern times.
