Chaerea, on arriving at Antipho's house, was disappointed to find that
the lattcr's parents were at home—a fact that rendered it daugemus ior
him 10 enter. Accordingly he has been unable to exchange his eunuch'a
dress ior that of an ordinary citizen. Ile now returns ln the direction oi
Thais' house, aiter having narrowlyescaped observationby an acquaintance.
Thais reproaches him for his raah conduct, and receives a oool rejolnder.
But aiter she has explained her purpose regarding Pamphila, Chaerea takes
beart, and conceives the idea 01 making Thais his iriend and ally. Thais is
only too ready to lall ln with Chaerca's plan to maire Pamphila his wiie,
and bids him awalt the coming oi Chremes, who has gone to fetch the old

nurse through whose testimony the true parentage oi Pamphila is to be
established. Chaerea and Thais go into the house to aweit Obremcs' arrival,
despite tire protestatione oi Pythias, who distructa the young man's inten-

tions.
