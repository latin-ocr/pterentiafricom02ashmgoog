12 INTRODUOTION ,

At Rome also the Aeetam were raised, through liter-ary treatment,
to a comparatively high level. This took place as early as the time of
Sulla, when Novius and Pomponius oi Bononia gave to these iarees a
definite literar-y form. Before this the dialogue bad been largely im-
provised, or if written was at least not published. The characters be-

cameconventional at an early date. Such werePcppue the pentalocn, ,
vain but deluded, the buffoon Maccus, Bucco the braggart, and the ¹

cunning rogae Dorsennus, —pereonagee in many respecta analogous to
the clowu and harlequin oi a modern pantomimo, and calculated
tc portray, in burlesque and caricature, the life of the country towns

and villages. The plote were simple though generally prearranged‚ the i

incidente numerous and always grotesque, the jokes wulgar but telling.
The Atellanae also were used as modia, especially after tragedias, like
the sumeremus cf the Greeks ; but they never resorted to Greek lite
for their subjecte, except when tragedy was travestied, and were always
far more natioual in their character than the regular Roman comcdy.

ΖΟ. The metre employed iu the Atellnn iarces and other early
dramatic forms was naturally of Italian origin. It is known as the
r Saturnian, but its exact character is doubtful. Probably it wae not

quantitative like the Greek matres, but purely accentual, like the ἵ

metros of English verse. Yet the remeius are not sufficient to admit
of any dogmatism on this point. According to the aocenmral theory,
the Saturnian line falls into two halves, the first of which has three
theses, the second usually three (sometimes two), as in the follow·

This metue was preferred by Naevius in bis poem on the first Punic
war (i 28); but it was gradually displaced ογ the metres of the
Greeks, which were adopted by Ennius and by succeeding poete, and
were used even in the Atellan {arces after those had reached a certain
stage of literary development.

native hama, eomparable with that of Athens, should have grown out
