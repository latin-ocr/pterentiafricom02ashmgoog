These, with the Viduam, arc perhaps¹ the sameas the twenty-one
selected by Varro out of the one hundred and thirty already alluded
to, and set down by that learned man —if Gellius (3. 3. 1) has reported
him correctly-as universally acknowledged 10 be from the pen 01
Plautus himself (0011101110 omnium Plauti 0110 censebantur). The
term schedae Varronianus applied to this list of dramas is somewhat
,inexact since it seems to make Varro himself responsible for the gen·
uineuess 01 the plays in question, whereas Varro merely reports the
judgment passed upon them by others² The great popularity of Plau·
tus was often the occasion 01 the unfair use 01 his name in connection
with the authorship 01 new plays, the names 01 'whose real authors
were not disclosed. To so great an extent was this true that out of
the large number 01 plays ascribed to Plautus not more thau nineteen,
orer and above the socalled Varronianus, were regarded in the time
01 Gellius as having any claim whatever to authenticity; the rest,
amouuting to ninety, were deemed to be spurious. .

32. That Plautus was not a slarish imitator 01 his Greek originale
ismsdc apparent by reference 10 his plays, in which other influences
are traceable beside the inspiration afforded by the Greek model itself
(1 21). Much of the coarse wit and roguery with which his plays

abound may have been suggested by the Atellan 10100, which was intro· ·

duced into Rome about the time when Plautus began to write for the
stage3 and the effect upon his mind 01 the Roman festivals, whose
merriment and spirit 01 revehy he was fain 10 imitate in his dramas,
would account for that absence 01 moral tone, and extreme looseness
01 conduct, 101 which some 01 his plays are noted. But Plautus did
not lack an example 10 justify him in introducing this clement into his
writings‚ since Aristophanes had done the same before him, only using
instead the language of the Dionysiae revels, than which nothing could
be more glaringly opposed to the proprieties of modern life. Another
influence too may have been at work to lead Plautus away from strict
adherence to his Attic models 01 the New Comedy‚ -an influence sug-
gested by Horace (Epist. 2. 1. 58), who accuses him 01 imitating the
Sicilian Epicharmus (ξ 2). Now Epicharmus was essentially refined;
yet his comedy was 01 the nature of burlesque, like the Dorio farce (§2)
