INTRODUCTION

PROSODY

87. In reference ιο the prosody oi Terence, it should be remarhed
that the rules for classical Latin apply far more strictly in his case
thau in that of Plautus. This is owing, not so much ιο a difference
Ι in point citime between the two writers, aa to the education and aeso-
clatione of the younger poet. But in both Plautus and Terence the
influence oi the old Saturnian metre is clearly perceptible; see ξ 20.
This matre, probably, was accentual (as has been said) rather than
quantitative, and its effect upon the verse of the Roman playwrights is
seen in the frequency with which the ictus (beat) of the measure and
the word-accent coincide in their writings. To appreciate this point it
is only necessary ιο compare their lines with those of Vergil, in whom
the ictus is wont to clash frequently with the ordinary arcent of the
words as pronounced in every-day speech. A line taken from Shake-
speare, Ham. 1. 2, will illustrate this : —

In equal scale, weighlng dellght and dole.

Here the natural word-accent of “welghing '' olashes with the accent .

of the verse, and is overpowered by it, if the verse be read with full
regard to the metrical beat¹

88. The accents printed iu the Latin text of these plays indicate the ἵ
principal ictus in each dipody. Another and lighter verse-accent, not
so marked, falls upon the corresponding long syllable in the other
ioot of the dipody. .

89. The coincidence of the ictus with the acoent received by any ,
given word in ordinary speech will be found ιο occur oftener in Plautus
and Terence than at first sight seems probable. The language of these
writers is so largely taken from that oi everyday conversation that it
becomes necessary to consider the question of stresa as it occurred in
certain word-groups peculiar to the sermo cottidianus. In these word·
