Clitipho retires, leaving Clinia and Syrus to receive Bacchis aad Antiphila

ACT 11. BCENE ⁴.

Bacchis discourses ιο Antiphila on the superior happiness 01 those women,
who, like Antiphila, have made it a principle 10 be faithful 1ο one lover.
Subsequently Clinia is recognized by Antiphila, and an affectionate greeting
takes place.

The coatrast in character between the seli-secking aad commonplace
Bacchis, and the tender, selidenying Antiphila, is one 01 Terence’s best
strokes, and points to an important distinction in the social relations 01 the
Greeks—the distinction between the class 01 meretrices, represented by
Bacchis, and the 001100 pro acore, or wife in all but the name, presented to
us ln the person 01 Antiphila. The future conduct and destlny of these two

characters isalready suggested in the manner 01 their hrst presentation to

the audience.
