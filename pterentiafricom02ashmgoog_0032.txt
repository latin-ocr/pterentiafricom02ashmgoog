INTRODUCTION 17

used at Rome as an arena of political varlare, however much it may
have been thus employed at Athens by the writers oi the Old Comedy.

28. The spirit by which Naevius was largely animated is discernible
in the extant fragments, which suggest the personal and political tone
and independence of Aristophanes. Nevertheless his comedies were all
palliatae. His excesdve patriotism, however, led him to become the
inventor of a new kind of drama, known as the fabula praeteata (ξ 23),
in which themes of national interest were treated, such as the events
ol the reign of Romulus, or the victory oi Marcellus over the Gauls at
Clastidium in 222 Β. c.; in fact, Roman history in general was drawn
upon to furnish material for the praetentae. But even this essentially
Roman species of drama was Greek in outward form and arrange-
ment. Only fragments of the mactemus have survived. But the fame
of Naevius seems to rest lar less upon his success in dramatic composi·
tion than upon the national epic which his experience as a soldier in
the first Punic war, combined with his naturally fiery and vigorous
temperament, rendered him peculiarly well fitted to undertake. The
Bellum Poenicam¹ of Naevius was composed in Saturnian verse.

29. But perhaps no fragment of his writings is more characteristi-
’ cally illustrativc of his manner and his general qualities than his epi·
taph, which Gellius (1. 24. 2) has transmitted to us with the information
that it was written by Naevius himself. Here we sce his independent
spirit, and genuine appreciation oi his own merits. Ii his words are

This epitaph is characterized by Aulus Gellius as plenam superbiae
Campanae, “ full ol Oampanian arrogance,” from which the inference
has been drawn that Naevius was a native of Campania3 but the active
