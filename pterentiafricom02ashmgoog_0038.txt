IN'PRODUUPION 23

saturae Ennius won distinction, and the fragments which survive under
the title of Ambraca¹ have been thought to belong to a Praetexta.² Es· ‘
pecially is Ennius noted for his epic poem entitled Armaza, the extant
fragments oi which are very considerable. This poem deals with the his·
tory oi Rome, beginning with the wanderings of AEneas and continuing

until the poet's own times are reached. The extentos the subject ren· ,1

dered. necessary a divisiones the poem into eighteen books, in which ¹
respect it contrasted with the epic of Naevius, whose story of the Punic
war could be told in a single narrative. Ennius was born at Rudiae (now
Rugge) in 239 s. a, and was in speech and education a Greek; but as
the Oscan dialect was much spoken in southern Italy he was familiar
with that also. He afterwards learned Latin, and thus became expert iu
three different languages, - a lact that caused him to speak of himself
as having tria corda, or three souls.⁸ Ennius went to Rome in 204 s. a,
where he gave instruction araque liayrsa (Suet. Da Grata. 1), and
rose through his writings to intimacy with the great. His arrival in
Rome was an eventui the utmost importance to the future character
and development of Roman literature, for there he did more than
any other writer to establish Greek standards as opposed to Italian, ¹
and thus to determine the course which the stream of literary produc-
tion at Rome should eventually follow. He lived in humble circum-
stances on the Aventine hill, and had lor his friend and fellow·lodger
the poet Statius Caecilius. He died in 169 Β. e.

38. SrArrus CAECILIUS survived Ennius by only one year. In the
history of Roman comedy, he, and not Ennius, is conspicuous as the
successor oi Plautus, for his reputatiou as a writer of palliatae was
lar greater among the ancients than that of the author of the Aa·
aulas. Caecilius was an Insubrian Gaul, who came to Rome, probably
as a prisoner of war, about 194 Β. a. There he was liberated by his
master, a member of the Caecilian qaas, and took his name.⁴ When
, he began to write, Plautus was at the height of his reputation and in-
fluence,-·an elevation to which Caecilius was not destined to attain.
