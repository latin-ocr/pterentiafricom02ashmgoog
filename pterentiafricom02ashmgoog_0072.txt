INTRODUCTION 57

groups the accent ol the individual word was exchang'ed ior another
arcent belonging to the group taken as a whole. For example, if wc
apply the rules of accentuation to two or more words regarded as one
we shall have such phenomena as the following: potitis quom, apdd
me, aoscdat sua, iatir se, aas miseri mihi, wherein the verse-accent
and the aucant of the group, aethe latter was heard in prose or com-
mon speech, are identical. Such word-groups arose from a natural
tendency to attach the subordinate words iu a sentence to those which
were important or prominent.1

90. The tendency in the earliest Latin was to throw the aoceut back
upon the first syllable, whatever the length of the word. Consequently,
when we find in Plautus the verse-accent falling upon the first syllable
of a word of four syllables, having the first three short (e. g. fitadius),
we are entitled to assume that in thir word the two accents were still
coincident. In the time of Terence, however, this is less certain. In
his day this tendency was giving wey to the custom, which afterwards
became regular, of placing the accent on the antepenult, not only in
words like fdoilius, but also in those quadrisyllabio forms in which
the first syllable was long: e. g. dissimili, quaoddqaidem. However,
Terence has fdcilias, radliaoli, rilioacrn, mdlicrem, odrrdioio, qadudo-
paridem, etc, as well as dissimili, quandoquidem, audather instapces
of the later rule regardiug the stressed syllable.

91. Itis natural that accent should cause the syllable on which it
lalls to receive strength or weight at the expense ol the syllable
that precedes or follows it. Accordingly, long syllables adjacent to
the accented syllable often become short, in dramatic poetry. In the
most remote period of the language nearly all suffixes had long
vowels. But the law restricting the word-accent to the penult and
antepenult did much to increase the natural tendency toward a neglect
of final syllables in pronunciation. Thus, many final syllables once
long became short, short syllables were correspondingly obscured, and
final consonante were often dropped altogether. Especiallywas this
true in the case oi iambic words, or dissyllables with short penult, as
in the imperatives adyti, idle, odai, ridi, etc, and in declensi0n‚ as

y nouo, liu-i, heri, utros, aud likewise ip such words as dpud, quidem,
