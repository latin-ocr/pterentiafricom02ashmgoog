of the difficulty. As Don. read ternadena, Fairclough would 10011101οπ-
darnat, place a comma aiter eptas ait, and suppose an ellipsis (et itu ayo
agam, or the like) before ut This obviates the difficulty involved in the
awkward combination qaia . . . ut. See Τ. A. P. A. vol. xxx, pair-¹13,
and Fairelough's Arrdria

729. adposlsse: the Mss, here, 111142 andin 763 have cupam. But
Da. (Adra. Orat.) compares Ritschl, Opnsc. iv. 119 f.

738. 'l'hough ut is generally accepted, aut gives good meaning, as “or ’

(ii) you see any further reason (why I should remain).'’

756. ancilla: retained by blech, Spen, and Klotz, who reject narratrix.
But meretric has more force here than emittm see note.

787. Fleck. seems to go too far in accepting ne hare tornea, even on the
authority of Priscian. Fairclough follows Fleck.; see his crit. noto.

807. huc me attan: like Plaut. Amph. 989 eiua iussa nunc hac me
adsero. attuli is attested by Priscian (II. p. 68). appuli would mean,
“I came by sea‚’' -as in fact he did. But appellare with a reflexive pron,
ior appellare canera, is rare, ii not απαξ alp.

814. grandicula: possibly in A and probably in some early MS. now
lost. Hauler defends grandiusculo in Archia, V. 294.

816, 11011 lubet: Ipreier non licat (with Fairclough)‚ the reading of
ΡΟ Β 0, Don, and Eugr. 'l'he text follows the testimony oi Da.

836. luta: thus.Bentley and Meis.; but ficto is the reading of Klotz,
Wag, spen„ Flebis„ Fairclough. See Τ. A. P. A.. vol. xxx. p. 12.

849. responde: Umpr„ Fleck. (ist ed), Spen„ following Don, change
to respuendas-rightly, since this construction is regular in impatient ques-
tions, and a may easily have fallen out in the arsis oi the foot. ef. Hanni.
235, Pharan. 542, Aa 550. Her. 841 is different. The construction is fre-
quent in Plaut. 'l'he imp.. however, sometimes appears asa development
from the indie, asin quin dia (45), where see note. ,

850. modo, etc: for confirmation oi Fleckeisen's reading (which is also
that oi the text) see Fairelough’s crit. note.

857. tristis ueritas: discussed and defended by Fairclough. Ohas
malina which is accepted by Spem, Wag.‚ Klotz. Other editors give
acuemus, with most MSS. ·

861. sublimen: MSS. here and in Aa. 316 have sublimem = “raised
aloit,'' “liited from tha ground '’; but sublimn is better arithenticated in
Plaut, and is thought by Ritschl to be the only correct form. See Rana.
Mas. 1850, p. 556. See also Ritschl, Opaca. ii. 462 ff.; 0. Ribbeck in N.
Jahrb. 1858, p. 184 ff. Cf. Fowler on Plaut. Man 994, Spengel’s note on
the present passage, and Dz. on Aa. 316. But Klotz, in his excursus on
this passage, argues against the recognition oi sublimen, and Fairclough

holds that sublimem has been proved to be correct by W. Heraeus in Par·-
