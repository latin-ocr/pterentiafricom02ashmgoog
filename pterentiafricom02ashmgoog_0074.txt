INTRODUCTION 59
94. Α mute followed hyl or r invariably fails to make the syllable

long, in Terence.

95. Iudifference to doubled consonante teuded to a like reeult iu
early Iatin- ln feet doubled consonante were not regularly written
in Iatin before the time of Ennius, and the pronunciatiou cf worda
like ille, quippe, immo, ιιιιιιιι, etc, eceme to have fluctuated. Thue,
in Plautus the pronoun itte often shows the apparent scansion tlte, and
iu Terence aleo thie ia not infrequently the oeae. Compare, ι. g, tlte
quem (Ad. 72), tut qui illam (Phorm.109),and immo, ιιιιιιιι, tp
Ριιιιιιιι oppressionem in Ad. 483, 720, 81, aud 238 respectively.¹

96. Serranam? or the fusion of two or more adjacent vowel eouude
into one, is found often in Pleutue and Terence. Thne, of couree, in deice
the two sho1t vowel eounde ere prononuced with a elur, aud similarly
in other forme of this word, aud in the poeeeasive prononne. Itis the ·
same with the venons forms of ce end ιἰἰιιι, ι. ..g eca= —yoa Sofciaee' re
pronounced fwcleee, and' m like manner the other perfect forme of ecee.
Other examplee of thie treatment are, dica, diei, acio, aiebam: cibam,
ιίιιιιΞ aio, ott: ait, tutus (prouounced Ιιιιιιιι), quotue (praebe),
mcle‘er3 two vowele sounded as one when brought together by oom-
position, es in proin, dehinc, deinde, deire, antebac, ἀῶνιιιιιι, ιιοιιιιιιι,
caue: ceu, eud many more.

97. Hmnus rs properly the absence of synaloephe, and ιι of rere
occurrence iu 'Perenne' It ie admitted (1) after an interjection, (2) et '
a change of speakers, (3) in the caesura or diareeie of the verre, (4)
where there ie a decided pause iu the sense. Most frequently, however,
both in Plautus and Terence, hiatus is found iu caece where a mono-
syllable, ending ιιι e long vowel, or in ιιι preceded by a vowel, forme ’
the first syllable of e resolved thesis, the long vowel then becomiug
short, e. g me td, quc theim, duim erit (see Ae. 111, 215, 118). Cf.
Munro’s note on Lucretiue,' ιι. 404. ¹

¹ A plausible explanation of tlte iethet the final ἔ wae treated aa a eilent letter;
cl. the omission of ι in tic (ε hice) and in the particle -ne, ae iu uiden, ete, aud aee
Skutsch, Studien zwpleutim'eeheo Proeodie, Leipzig, 1892, pp. 30 ff. Thia view ie die-
puted by Radford iu a paper read before the Aruer. Phil. Aeson. in December, 1905.

² When thie huppem between two werde, it ia more correctly termed synaloepha

(ιιιιιλιιφᾶ, Quint. 9. 4. 36). .
