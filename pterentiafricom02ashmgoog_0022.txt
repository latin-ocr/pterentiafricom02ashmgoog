INTRODUCTION 7

l New Comedy fell little short of perfection. The Greek in which they
were written was capable ol expressing the fiuest shades of thought ο

and of polished wit, and the general mestery of detail and of tech-
ciqcc, ιο which their extant fragments hear witness—the result ot
two centuries of dramatic activity - rendered them particularly useful
and attractive as models to the inexperienoed playwrights of Rome.
12. It remains to he ohserved that the New Comedy‚ in its external

dress, exhibited cortaindepartures from earlier usage. Both the para-
basis and the prologue ceased to form an organic part of the play. The
former, indeed, disappeared altogether, while the latter was relegated
ιο a place outside of the marnatis action. The chorus, too, which at one
time had filled an important place in Attic comedy, now became little
more than a name. Its disappearance is easily accounted for, and was
in fact owing to the very nature of comedy itsell. The chorus belonged

¹ originally to the religious side of the drama-a side that tragedy
had been compelled to stand by. But comedy had little respect for
religion, aud was not tied down hy consideratione such as those which
limited the fonctions oi its more serious sister. The chorus, in fact,
was a distinct hindrance to the development of comedy in the direction
of s literal imitation of human passione and. of private and domestic
experiences. Eveu Euripides found himself clogged hy it in his efforts
to humaniue tragedy and reduce it to the level of ordinary life. Con·
sequently, when the comedy of Aristophanes began to change its char-
acter andto draw on the affairs ot private life forits materiale and plote, '
the chorus ceased to be esseutial; and although there is evidence of its
occasional use in Menander’s time, yet it is quite certain that Menan-
der sought opportunity to discard it altogether. Thus the chorus, in
which both tragedy and comedy had originated‚ proved eventually
to be a stumbling bloclr to the broadest development of the drama,
and was ultimately either reduced to a mere troupe of supernumerary
deucere, or dispensed with es altogether useless.1
