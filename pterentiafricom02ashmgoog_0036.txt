INTRODUCTION 21

to the Old Comedy of Athens than to that ol Diphilus and Menander.
Plautus makes frequent reference also to Greek scenas, sities and
money, to the sea, the barbour, and the arrival and departure oi ships;
and while the names of his plays are mostly Latin, those oi his person·
ages, their dress, manners and general behaviour, are evidently intended
to convey the impression tlrat Greek, not Roman life is being portreyedff]

34. Half af his plays at least,may fairly be called good comedies'.
These are: Amphitruo, Aulularia, Bacchides, Captiai, Menaechmi,
Miles, Mostellaria, Pseudolus, Radere, Trinaramas. Itis a question
whether wc should nat omit the Amphitruo from this list on account
of its apparent blasphemy, aud substitute in its place the Epidires.
But putting aeide the part played by Jupiter in the Amphitruo, and the
commenta of Mercury upon that part, the play is a comedy pure and
simple, and has been fairly described as one oi the best oi the plays
oi Plautus.¹ The ten (or eleven) plays above mentioned, without
reference ta the rest, are sufficient to show how wide was the range of
experience and observation for which Plautus is justly famous, and
how vastly in this respect is he superior to Terence ; but there are five
oi these for which a preference may bo distinctly felt, on the ground
oi their superiority to the remainder of the Plautino comedies, in va·
riety oi interest, style, character-pointing and the development oi the
plot. These five aree Aulularia, Oaptlui Menaechmi, Pseudolus,
Badera—unless for the Rudens we substitute the Bacchides.

35. All oi the plays are based on Greek originals3 the Oastna and
Rauen are known to have been taken from plays of Diphilus, the
Mercator aud Trinummns from plays oi Philemon, the Asinaria from ’
a play of Demophilus, the Bacchides most probably from one by
Menander. Many of them have been imitated² in modern times, e. g,
the Amphitruo by Molibre and Dryden in plays of the same name, the

Aulularia by Malibre in L’Anare, and the Menaechmi by Sbakespeare
in the Conway of Errare.

his influenca on the whole, was good. The Romans in bis¹ day were a
