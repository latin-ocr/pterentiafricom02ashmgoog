. 24 INTRODUCTION

His success, great as it became, was neither so rapid nor so pronounccd
as that of Plautus, and the popularity which he acquired after Plautus’
death was at least in some measure dne to the skill of the actor, Am-
bivius Thrpio. Caecilius wrote comedies only, ·- most of them modelled

on plays of Menander. The Greek originalwas a thing of far greater y

importance to him than it had been to Plautus, though at the stant he ἵ

was much inclined to freedom in bis treatment of his Attic models. At
a later period this independence was moditied in the interest of the in·

creasing predilectiou of the Romans for things Greek, and Caecilius ,
began to adhere with greater fidelity to his literary sources. 'lhus the J

way was paved for the still more refined methods of Terence. Of the
many plays of Caecilius a few fragments bave been preserved and forty
titles, most of which are Greek. The fragments under agiveu title
are saldorn sufficient to afford a clear idea of the action of the drama

they 'represent those belongingto the comedy named Plocium, or ‘⁴ The ,

Neoklace,’' being perhaps the least obscure in this respect¹ By com-
paring several passages taken from this comedy with their Greek origi-
nale, Gellius (2. 23) undertakes to show how far Caecilius was a literal

translator, and to what extem he altered or departed from his model.

, From this comparison it appears that Caecilius introduced a certain

coarseness into his plays, for which Menander at least is hardly to Ἴ

be held responsible.

infer from the reference to him in Terence, Hea2. 14, that it was not
very great), it is evident from the large number ol the titles of his
plays that he ultimately gained the sympathy and appreciation which he
rought. Volcatius Sedigitas, as has been noticed, gives him first place
. in his list, and the verdict of Horace (Epist. 2. 1. 59) regarding him,

Vincere Caecilius grauitate, Terentius arta (dicitnr),
is certainly not unfavourable, while Varro commends him for skill in
