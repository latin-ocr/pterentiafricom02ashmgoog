The various complicatione of the plot have now reached their highest de-
velopment The plana oi Dauos have been frustrated. Charinus believes
hlmseli to have been betrayed hy Pamphilus, and Glycerium is suffering
from the conviction that she is deserted. Even Simo is nursing the hope
that Pamphilus, however unwillingly, can he induced at last to marry the
daughter oi Chremes, and Chremes himself has reluctautly given his oon-
sent toan arrangement irom which he will be forced by circumstances to
withdraw. Dauos, however, is already meditatlng new schemes which
eventually lead toa solution of all difficulties.

The scene opens with a watinum, in which Charinus expresses his in-
dignatlon at the treatment he has received at the hands oi Pamphilus. 'l'his
occuples the first iourteen lines, in which there is a mixture oi dactyllc,
oratic, lambio and hacchiao metrae, denoting the excitament of the speaker.
