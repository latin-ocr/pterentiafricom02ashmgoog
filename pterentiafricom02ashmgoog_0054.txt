either Greek tragedy or the Old Comedy is referred to, we allude to
nothing more than the separation from one another of ports of the
dialogne, by means of chorio songs. The several perte of a tragedy
are discussed by Aristotle (see Poct. xii), though nothing is said by
him about acts ; and yet it is possible to see, in what he affirma exactly
where the principle of the five-fuld division is to be found. The acted
ports of a tregedy, says Aristode, were three: the πρόλογος (or intro·
doctior), the ἐπεισόδιον (or plot), and the ἔξοδος (ordenamus).
These were separated from one another ογ chorio songs. But the
ἐπεισόδιον was subsequently broken into parts, also separated by chorio
conge, and this division of the ἐπεισόδιον, which was generally (though
not always) a triple one, combined with the πρόλογος and ἔξοδος, con·
stituted the normal structure of a Greek tragedy. This arrangement
of parts seems to have given rise to a tradition which the Alexandriam

made the basis of their canon that five was the proper number of acts ·

for a drama Thus, not only divisione of aGreek tragedy‚ bnt also the
parte of a Latin eomedy‚ which might be distinguished by pauses in
the action, came to be loosely regarded as acts, the rule of five being
the norm for all. The principle is more or less exemplified in the
five so-called acts of a Terentian eomedy. The first contains the state·
ment of the opening situation. This is analogous to' the πρόλογος of the
Greek drama, the real prologue of the Latin play being without bear· '
ing upon the action or the plot. The second, third end fourth acts
present the intrigne or plot proper as it is eleborated through three dif-
ferent states or phascs; these are parallel to the triple division of the
ἐπεισόδιον (three episodes). The fifth act is devoted to the denoccment,
corresponding tc the ἔξοδος of Aristctle.¹

eomcdy were not marked off by the commentatore of a later time with
special reference tc predetermined pauses in the action, as they would
hc in a modern drama, but rather out of deference to tradition, and in ,
accordance with the literary qualities of the play. ln modern times
the division into acts affords opportunity for the presentation of widely
' separated scenes and activities‚ -separeted, thetis, both in time and
