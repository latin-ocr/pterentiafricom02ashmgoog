36 INTRODUCTION

with the decline in popular favour of the comoedia palliata we trace a Ἰ

gradual degeneracy of the drama at Rome, -— a change, however, that

seems natural enough when we contemplate the very general disap· l
pearance oi high standai-ds oi conduct in the days of the Caesars, and
compare the public morale of this period in Romc's history with the

genuine and characteristic virtues oi the early Republic.

confined to his day and generation. Terence was read and studied
not only in the days of Cicero and Horace and Quintilian, but also in
the Middle Ages3 and indeed in more modern times as well his writ
ings have been pointed to and admired as poetic models. His influcnce
upon Horace is very marked, especially in the more familiar style of
the Satires and Epistles. The lines in Sat. 2. 3. 260 f, touching the
’ wcahness of human passion, are manifestly founded on the first scene
oi the Eunuchus, and the precepta of Horace’s father regarding the
correction ol the son's failings have a distinct parallel, though a

aucupare} Petrarch speaks of tlre two Roman comedians in terms oi
unlimited eulogy. Erasmus and Melanchthon and other Latin writers
oi the Renaissance committed his works to memory. The herich espe-
cially have been his ardent admirere and frequent imitatore. Sainte-
' Beuve praises him without stint, and Penelon is said to have preferred
him to Muliere² Another French writer, M. Joubertf says of him:
“Le miel Attique est sur ses levres 3 on croirait aisement qu'il nequit
sur le mont Hymette.'' We find his Aluna reflected in the Andrieuuc

L’It'uuuque,· the Phormio in Muliere’s Les Fourbert'es de Scapiu and
parts of the same writer's Le Muriupe Forat. Baron's L'Ilcole des
Peras and Fagan's Lu Pupilla are direct adaptatione of the Adelphos,
and to the same play Moliere ,is largely indebted ior his E'cole des
Maris. Terence’s plays have been imitated and adapted in England
also, e. g. the Adelplwe in Garriclr’s Guurda'uu, the Audriu in Steele's
Oouecicus Louers and the Fouudlc'uq oi Edward Maure, the Eunu
