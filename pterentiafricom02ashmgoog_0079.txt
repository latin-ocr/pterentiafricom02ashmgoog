Appendix to his edition ol the Andria (Boston, 1901) the same editor
notes “ that in the eighty-five lines oi that play, wherein we can eom·
pare A's readings with conflicting ones in D end P, A agrees with P ξ
nearly twice as often as with D.”

114. For some account of the (lonnx Monaesum (M), the oldest of
the MSS. containing lemmata, and assigned by Halm to the eleventh l
century, the reader is referred to Schlee’s Scholia Terentiana (Leipzig, ζ
1893), and to a review (by the writer) oi the same, in Closs. Rev. ]
vol viii. 8. Many MSS. of Terence, other than those herein described, l

exist in European libraries3 one oi them is mentioned by Wessner in (
the preface to his edition oi Donatus, vol. i; but those alluded to above ¹
constitute nearly, if not quite, all oi the codices which have thus far
impressed themselves upon scholare, as worthy oi serious study. cf. y
however the DniatzkeHauler “ Phormio,’' p. 189, note 3. l
115. The Senomn of Terence have been edited by Umpfenbaeh
(Hermes ii) for A, while the work oi Frid. Schlee above mentioned is l
an attempt to bring within convenient reach all that is valuable of the ¹
scholia contained in the other MSS, and to establish the velue oi

p these scholia as equal‚ or nearly so, to that of the scholia of the Bem-

bine codex. See Closs. Rev. vol. viii, pp. 353-4.

116. Oi the grammarians (beside Calliopius: see ξ 98) whose com·
mentaries supplement the evidence of the MSS, the most important
is Aelius Donatus, who taught at Rome about the middle oi the fourth
century A. n, and was the reputed master oi St. Jerome. That part oi l
his Terentiae commentary which related to the Heauton timoratam l
is lost, but its place is indifferently supplied by J. calphurnius, who
wrote in the fifteenth century. The commentary of Eugraphius, who
is believed to have lived in the sixth century, survives, and has some
value for us. The grammarian Servius (who wrote at Rome in the
fourth century, and is best lmown to us through his commentary on ξ

Vergil) and the more iamous grammarian Priscianus (who wrote in
Latin at Constantinople in the latter part of the liith or the begin· η
ning of the sixth century) furnish occasional informantem and Marcus y
Valerius Probus of· Berytus is known to have revised and anno· ³
tated Terence as wellas other Latin authors, in the first eenhrry oi
the Christian era. Other early commentatore were Aemilius Asper,
