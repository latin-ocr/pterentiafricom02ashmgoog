Atthis point there appears upon the scena a certain relative 01 Chrysis,
whose name is Crito. Ha has arrived 111 Athens 110111 Andros, and has come
to claim the property 01 his cousin, whose heir-at-law he is, being her near·
estol kin. He is much disturbed 011 hearing that Glycerium has not yet
discovered her parents, 111010 particularly since Glycerium had always
passed as the sister 01 Chrysis aud would 111 this capacity inherit 1101 pro
perty, rather than himself. This would make necessary a suit at law to
establlsh his actual title. His testimony however brings about the rocog-
nition 01 Glycerium as the daughter 01 Chremes, and ls tha occasion oi 1110
