space, however closely they may be related as cause and effect. But
in an ancient play, of whatever sort, there was little opportunity to
represent actions not closely confincd within a limited area and a
comparatirely brief period ol time. Thero was no dropping or raising
of a curtain except at the beginning and end of the performance.
Variations or changes in the scenery were not extensive3 in the
plays of Plautus and Terence they were not even contemplated. If
the separation oi the 'dialogus porticus of a Greek tragedy by chorio
songs affords a parallel to what ultimately became known to the
Romans as a division into acts, it was iu reality quite a different thing
from that which is now meant by the phrase, for the representation of
the action in the Greek tragcdy was invariably continuone throughout
No pauses were required by the structure of the drama, and none was Χ
made. The sams was true of the Old Attio Gomedy, and to all intents Ἰ
and purposes ci the New. Nor did Roman tragedy or comedy differ ἵ
in this respect from the Greek. When, then, Cicero and Horace use the
word cottis, they employ it in a restricted sense, and in conformity,
probably, with some rule of Alexandrian origin, growing out of the
Greek divisione of tragedy just mentioned. That Cicero recognized
the five-act division ol a drama is probable, for he makes use of the . ¹

. figurative expression, io quarto cetu improbitatis ( Verr- 2. 2. 6.18),

and the division into three acts, which Donatus at a later dats repre·
sents as the mle for tragedy (sce Don. on Ad. iii. 1), was certainly
familiar to him (cf. ad Q. Fr. 1. 1. 16. 46). It is doubtful, however, ’
whether, in his reference to a triple division, it is tragedy or comedy
ol which Cicero is thinking; but if it be the latter, then we may sup-
pose that in Cicero’s time it was customary to mark three pauses in a
Latin comedy by means of musical interludes‚ and these pauses might
easily have been made to indicate the opening statement, the plot or
intrigus, and the demanant already mentioned.

61. The division into acts of a Plautino or Terentiam drama, when·
ever it first took place, was somewhat assisted by the division of sech
play into orvnnars (namnam) and cunnos, the latter being a reflec-
tion of the choric songs ol the earlier comedy of Athens. (Sse§ 84.)
