INTRODUOTION 65

Arruntius Celsus, Helonius Acro, and Euanthius. The metrical sum·
marles or periochae written for the several plays by Sulpicius Apolli·
naris of Carthago, who flourished iu the first hali of the second century
aiter Christ, together with the didascalice or prefatory notices, which
had boen prefixed to the plays of Terence within a century aiter
the poet’a death, are not without their velue in the determination
of the text.

117. Among scholare and editore oi Terence who are worthy of
mention as having contributed to our knowledge of tho text since the
publication oi the editio princeps (Strassb. 1470), Gabriel Fadrnus
(Florence, 1565) is well known for his careful examinatior ot the
Codex Bembinus, and ior the discovery of its superior importunae
indetermining the text; Guyet (1657) is noted for his scholarship‚
and his readiness to condemn as spurious those passages which he
found difficnlt of interpretation. More famous, however, than either
of these is Richard Bentley, whose edition oi Terence (Cambridge,
1726; Ameterdam, 1727) ie noted for the excellence of its critical
commentary, which marked a distinct advance in Terentian scholarship.
This commentery is still valuable, and is· perhaps the best extant wit
nese to Bentley’s critical acumen.

118. For more than a century after Bentley no edition of Terence
appeared which could be mentioned as presenting a decided improve-
ment οἰ the text. But an advanoe was made by Α. Fleckeisen,
whoee Terence was first published at Leipzig, in the Teubner series,
in 1857, and again in the same series, with many alterations, in 1898.
The edition by E. St John Parry (hond. 1857), though valuable
tor ite explanatory notes, is otherwise of slight importance. The crit-

ical value oi Wagncr’s edition (Inud. 1869) is impaired by careless-
ness. Urnpfenbach’s edition (Berlin, 1870) was greatly iu advance oi
all that had gone beiore it, and still turnishes the apparatus criticus
needed as a basis ior work on the tert.¹ Deiecto iu this apparatus have
meu pointed ont by later scholare, among whom are Minton warren,

Bauler and Schlee. Yet its ralue as a starting point can hardly be
overeetimated. But Dziatuko's text of the six plays (Leipzig, 1884),
