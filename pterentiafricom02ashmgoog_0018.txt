4. Greclr eomedy passed through three recognized stages oi devel-
opment at Athens, und hsd reached the last of these nearly u century

before it was transferred to Rome. The first was the Old Comedy
η already mentioued. The second and third were the Middle aud the
New Comedy respectively. The divisione are of course arbitror-y, end
it is difficult to determine accuratcly when the first or the second species
gere place to its successor. After Atheus hed lost her politieal inde
pendenee, comedy was shorn of its state authority and was compelled
to abendon its tone of censorship end its pcrsoual end politieel satire.
Its caricature was more and more coufined to mythology and to litersry,
philosophie and soeial life; its outward form also uuderwent a change.
Both the sice and the functione of the chorus were reduced, the pure·
basis, or address to the spectatore, disappeared, aud the seeuie acces·
series became less numerous and important. Of such a nuture was the
Middle comedy‚ which was in itself merely a transitiou from the Old
to the New. The period of this transition may be roughly marked as be·
ginning with the close of the Peloponnesian war in 404 u. ο. and ending
about the time of the accession of Alexander the Grect iu 336 Β. c, when
the liberties of Greeee hed been already erushed by Philip of Macedon.
During this time the Atheniens gradually abandoned their interest in
i public questions, and comedy‚ following the populor bcnt, passed by
1 degreer from personalities to generalities‚ and lost its former character
¹ aud vigour. The most distinguished poete of this period were Alexis
and Antiphanes, if we except Aristophanes himself, two of whose plays,
the Plutus and the Ecclesiaeueae, are more properly elusscd under the
, Middle Comcdy.

5. The New Comedy was the natural outcome of nll that hsd gone
before it. It may be said to have endured for nearly a century, cover·
¹ ing the years from 336 to 250 B. o, during which period more than
sixty poets of this school are said to have flourished. Among them the
most distinguished is Menander (i 10), who has besu called the Star of
r the New Comedy. Next in importauee are Diphilus and Philemon. Of
