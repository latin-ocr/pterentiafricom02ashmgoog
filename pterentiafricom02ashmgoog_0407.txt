among both Greeks and Romans, the father oi a new·born infant was called

upontodecidewhether it shouldbereared orexposed todeath. Iihedecided ³
upon the former course he formally raised (tollere) the child from the ground l
or other place where it had hoen laid ior the purpose. Hence the expressions 3
τέκνα ἀναιρεῖσθαι and liberos tollere, which mean “to bring up,'’ “to rear.” ,

Otherwise the child was “ exposed.'' cf. Aa. 809. ¹

Such a mixture is common in Greek, and may have existed in the original.
221. ciuem Atticam esse hanc: this proves 6ο 66 true in 666666, so

that, as Dauos remarks in 780, Pamphilus would be under legal obligation ’

to marry her even if he did notin reality wiell to do so. Ter. is here pre·

paring ior the 6666666666, hinc improves the sense by making it clear at l

once that the acervatur came from Athens. fult olim : cf. 923.

of Andros, as appears from 923-928. ihi tum: see on 106.

225. The fiatness oi this remark suggests that the vs. crept into the text

from the margin where it stood as a comment on sedulae. atque, “and l

yet”; so also 607; Ad. 40; Pharan. 369, 666. commentum, ‘⁴ the fiction.''

nor 11. sonus ³. [1. 4.]

Mysis, maid-servant to Glycerium, comes out oi the house, and while
doing so pauses at the threshold to continue her conversation with Archylis,
her fellow-servant, who had been urging her to go in haste and fetch
Lesbia, the midwiie. Archylis does not appear upon the stage, 666 may be
seen by the spectatore just within the doorway.

228. Archylis (from ἄρχειν, in reference to her position of authority within
the household) is an older woman than Mysis. Lesbiam: lit. “ the Les·
hiau woman''; from Lesbos, an island where the grape was grown in abun·
dance. She was addicted to drink (temulento), and therefore, ln the opinion
of Mysis, was hardly the right person to 66 summoned on the present oeca-
sion.
