Chremes and Simo may be imagined as having been in conversation within

the latter's house since vs. 789. They step forth while their discussion ls ¹

persists iu his determination to have nothing more ιο do with Pamphilus,
wh0, he is convinced, has bis affectione tired on Glycerium, au Attlc citizen,
aud is therefore ln every way uniitted to be entrusted with the sate-keeping
aud the happiness of Chremes’ daughter.
