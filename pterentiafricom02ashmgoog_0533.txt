152 NOTES

1044-9. Chaerea, belleving himself to be alone, gives full vent ιο his joy·
oua feelings. lt may be inserted from 1041 that he is expecting his brother

Phaedria.
AO'P V· som 9.

Phaedria appears from Laches' house, having heard a full account oi the
δ situation from Parmeno. Hc and Chaerea congratulata each other, while
Thraso ls in utter despair. The captain begs Gnatho soto arrange matters
for him that he may at least have a share in 'Phaia’ good greces. This
Gnatho accomplishes by appealing to the characteristic greed oi tire young
men, who are persuaded that 1ι would not be a bad thing to make a friend

01 Thraso and thus take advantage of his good dinners and cf his readiness ⁴

to hestow favours upon Thais, whose naturai extravagance it may be beyond
their means ιο gratify. They decide accordingly ιο receive both Gnatho and
the captain into their company.= While this decision is undoubtedly due
ιο the pcet's desire ιο represent all parties as satisiled and happy attha
conclusion of the play, 1ι cannot but place both Phaedria and Chaerea in
an unfavourable light before the spectatura, who can hardly find pleasure
in anything so unworthy aa the pretence oi friendship for purely sordid
purposes.
