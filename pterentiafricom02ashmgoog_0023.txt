8 INTRODUCTION

drama in Italy are found in the ceremonias which attended the worship
of various rustic deities, —more particularly (in Latium) that of Vic-
tory, whose festival developed finally into the celebrated Ludi Romani.
The Greek mama, as we have seen, developed on Greek soil, until it
reached perfection at Athens in the form and manner already indicated.
The Roman drama, so far as its native Italian clement was concerned,
attained only a limited -development; and although it might have
arrived in time at a stage corresponding to that of the Attic tragedy
and comedy, it was arrested in its progress in consequence of the im·
portation into Italy of the perfected and refined drama of the Greeks.
This was more especially true of comedy, which owed its existence at
Rome (in the form in which it has been handed down to us) to a nnion
of two elementa, via, the early Italian drama (if it may be so called)
and the comedy of the Atheniens. The latter, however, was themora im·
portant clement, - so much so, indeed, that it practically supplanted
the former altogether, or at least determincd forever the form and char-
acter which Roman comedy was to assume, and thus prevented the
growth of a purely Italian comio literature.

114. Comedy at Rome therefore took the form of an adaptation of
the New Comedy ol Athens to Roman requiremonts and tastes, and
the result was a reproduction in the Latin language of the refinements ,
'of Philemon and Menander, united with much of the coarseness of the ἵ
more or less impromptu dialogues of the Satara and the Versae Fes-
cennini. These last were of purely Latin origin. The Mimos and the
Fabula Atellano were not. All four, however, were independent oi ¹
the regular Athenian drama, and were exceedingly popular as forms
of public entertainment.

15. The Fescennina verses were generally extemporaneous and 2
abounded in johas, gross personalities and abuse. They reached, in·
deod, such an extreme of license that at last they were restrained by a
law of the twelve tables.l They were generally amoehaean or respou-
sive in character, and in later times were often sung at marriage fes- l
tivities and in triumphal processions3 but they never attaiued moro
than a limited literary development. There were clearly to be seen
in them, however, the germs oi a genuine drama, justas in the rude
