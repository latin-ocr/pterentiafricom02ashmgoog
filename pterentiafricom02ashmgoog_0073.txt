58 INTRODUCTION

aas, peram, senec, etc, whose final consonant thus fails to make posi-
tion with an initial consonant in the following word. This tendency
was partly checked by Ennius for the literary Latin, so that in authors
subsequent ιο Plautus and Terence wc find many final syllables of y
iambic words restored to their original long quantity. If the verse- l
nocent fell on the final syllable, the effect was ιο cause the natural long l
quantity of that syllable to be retained This principle held good also
for words of three 0r more syllables, as &malci (Hercul. 57 5) Alsclee’ac'isl
(Ad. 260), alwine (Ac 346), decipit (Ecca 1082), cclqecit (Aa. 25). l
In fact the effect of the verse-accent extended ιο all iambic combina- ,
tions, and may be expressed rn general as follows. Wleo tltefirstsyl-
loll e of aa lambio aequem (a .), or tlte syllable following] cc lamech
sequence, receives tle ictas, tle seconcl syllable of the sequence may be
sleovteaed. Thus ι. is measurcd as dc, and v Α may become o v ε’.
“ The short that precedes the long which isto be shortened must bc a
monosyllable or begin a word.’'¹ A few examples are: secl estne
(Ad. 569), ebt domam (Aac. 255), caim pl (Plorm. 113), ονᾶι missa

(Ad. 618). The principle stated is the so-callcd Iambic Law3 and l

verse· ·,accent there' rs no doubt that the word· accent would have similar
force were it not that the two most frequently unite to produce the
results described. ¹
, 92. The tendency to shorten long unaccented syllables was assisted
by a general inclinatior ιο slur over or obscure final consonante, cs· ³
pecially d, l, m, a, r, s, ι, as illustrated in some of the examples given
above. Hence the seeming violation of the law of position, which is ¹
so strictly observed in Augustan poetry‚ for since one of two consonante
might be obscured or wholly dropped the syllable itself war not made l
long, -· a peculiarity not confined to the last syllables of words.

93. In Terence, final sinvari'ably fails to make position with a follow-
ing consonant, and sven as late as the time of Cicero it was only faintly
pronounced.¹ Cicero however (Orator, 48.161) speaks of this habit of
slnrring the letter s as countrified (cadwallonem), though he admits
that the custcm was once regarded as refined, and indeed that he
practised it himself in his early poetry. ’
