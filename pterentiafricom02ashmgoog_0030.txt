INTRODUCTION 15

³ 25. Of the plays of Livius onlya few lines have reached us, but·
these suffice to make clear their Greek origin, and to show that, in

his dromas at least, if notin his translation of the Odyssey, Greek
matres alone were employed. His dromas are slightingly criticized
by Cicero, who says they are noa satis dignae quoe iterum loquatur.¹
But Cicero was not always fair in his judgments, and probably was

not wholly capable ol appreciating how much had really been accom-
plished by Livius as a pioneer. Had it not been lor Livius Androni-
cus, even the great Ennius would have been less famous, for the latter
was compelled to base his literary endeavours upon the acquired taste
ol the Romans for Greek standards‚ - standards that might never have
existed had not the way for them been paved by the older dramatist.
Tbat Livius was held in high esteem by both his contemporaries and
successore is sufficiently established hythe fact that he was chosen to
produce the plays enacted at the Ludi Romani in 240 Β. o, by the use
ol his Odyssey as a school-book, not only in his own time but fora period
ol two centuries alter his death,² and by the appropriation of the tem·
ple ol Minerva on the Aventine hill to the use of poets, in his especial
honour. Livius died in 204 Β. c. His time marks the nnion of the
Italian clement of the drama, as portrayed in the Fescennina verses,
the Saturae, the mimes and the Atellan fames, with the plote, the
characters, the witty and philosophical dialogues of the New Comedy
of Athens; and the date of the productiori of his first play may be set
down as the birth-year of the Comoedia Polliata, and indeed of Latin
literature in general.

26. The principal writers of palliatae, of whom we have any know-
ledge, sucoeeded Livius Andronicus within the periodos a century.
They are ordinarily referred to as Naevius, Plautus, Ennius, Caecilius,
and Terence. These and five other poets about whom very little is
known are mentioned by Volcatius Sedigitus, acritic who flourished
about the beginning of the first century Β. o. and is quoted by Aulus
Gellius (15. 24). The five others are named in the thirteen verses of
Sedigitus, which Gellius has preserved, and arethe following: Licinius,
Atilius, Turpilius, Trabea, Luscius. The last is Luscius Lanuvinus,
who has been made notorious through Terence’s prologues, while Tur·
