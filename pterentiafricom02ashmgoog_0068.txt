Dimeter Catalectic) :-

occurs here and there in Terence, generally as a clumam. It consiste

oi three complete feet followedby an incompleta loct, and may pro·

perly be called ternarius, on tho analogy cl the trochaic septenarius.

The other matres, as already remarked, are unusual iu Terence. They

are :-

Numberl occurs twice (611, 612) or, including 613, three times in
the Adelpboe¹ In tho Andria, vss. 626-634, number 2 appears nino
times. In 481-484 of the same play number 3 is found iour times.

Of number 4 there is but a single example in Terence, via, Andria,
625.

83. Thesevariousmetres wereadaptedtodilierent moods. That which
may be called the plain, prosaic mood- the meod oi persons engaged

in calm and familiar conversation, or in the simple narration oi laets, ’ ·

-wes usually expressed by means of iambic senarii. Hence this
metre, beside its use elsewhere, is generally found at the beginning
of a play, invariably so in Terence. If the mood oi the speaker be im·
passioned or excited he may give ntterance to iambic octonarii, or tu
troelraic septenarii. The latter however are not quite so well suited
as the former to greatly animated speech. Serio-comic strains aro

frequently given in iambic septenarii, and if part of a sceno is intended
to be sung the trochaic octonarius may be introduced. ’
