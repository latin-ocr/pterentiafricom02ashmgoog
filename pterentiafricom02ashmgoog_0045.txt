In 160 Β. a: The Hecyra; at the ludi funerales oi Aemilius Paulus
(second, but unsuccessful, presentation).

ln 160 n. a: The Adelphos ,¹ at the ludi funcrules of Aemilius Paulus. y

In 160 Β. e.: The Halym at thp ludi Romani (third and successful
presentation).

It appears from this that the Hecyra was attempted three times
during the lifetime of the poet. The question arises whether the
Hecyra was the only play brought out more than once during that
period,-a question depending for its answer upon an examination
of the prologues. These certainly point to a second performance at
least of the Andria, and probably ol the Heautontimorumenos,
Eunuchus, and Phormio. That the extent prologus to the Andria
was not written by Terence lor the first performance is highly prob
able. The Hecyra also was first attempted without a prologue.¹ Ἴ ’

48. In reference to the Greek originale from which these comedies
were taken it may be noted that in the case ol the Andria, Eunnuhus

and Adelphos, and possibly the Hecyra, Terence employed what has
been called mutaminulio, a noun connected with the verb mutanti
nure as the latter is used by Terence in his prologues to the Heauton
linwrumonos and the Andria. Thus applied by Terence, the verb has
reference to the process of combining parts of two or more Greek com-
adies so as to form a single Latin play-² Thus the Andria is based on
two plays of Menander, the Ἀνδρία and Περινθία; the Eunuchus also

on two plays of Menander, the Εὐνοῦχος and Κόλαξ; the Adelphos on
’ Menander’s Ἀδελφοί and a play of Diphilus entitled Σοναποθνῄσκοντες,

1 Karsten concludes that the Heautontimorumenos was performed, for the second
time, at the ludi Apollinares in 161 n. 0., and the Phormio at the ludi Romani, or
plebeii, in 160 n. c.; see Sylloye Lupdunensis (1893), p. 47; Mnemosyne, rol. 22
(1894), p. 178. For a possible presentation of the Eunuchus in 166 (or 165) n. o., see
Hauler's ed. of Dniatnlro's Phormio, p. 16, note 3. The second performanoe of the
Andria is placed by Karsten in 162 n. c.; see Mnemosyne, vol. 22 (1894), p. 175.
Thnt the Adelphos was performed at an earlier date, as well as on the oeeesiou
named, is very doubtfu13 see Hauler, p. ll, note 1, and Karsten, Mnemos. l. c.
p. 207.

² The noun contaminatio is not found in Terence.
