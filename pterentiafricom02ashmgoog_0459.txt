78 APPENDIX
451, Klotz, Ritter, Wag„ Fleck, Fairclough read deonotus (dep), ior

which see Engelbracht‚ Stadia Terent. p. 49. 9. Dz. and Spen. keep
obsonatum, with Bentley.

459. According ιο the traditional division Act iii would begin here instead
oi at 301.

483. post deinde: Fleck. has poste, which Fairclough says isnecessary,
aa deinde is always a dissyllabis in Ter. But while this is true oi winde in
lambio and trochaic matre, the rule does not apply to bacchiac verse,
wherein‚ as Speu. points out, Plaut. makes eveneoept‘ trisyllablc. poete is an
old form oi poet, found in Plaut. and Ennius

506. itast completas the octonarius.

516. Fleck. accepts this vs. in full, bnt changes mouentur to remoueatur.
So also spen, who however retains moueatur unaltered. The fiatness oi
⁴ the line is apparent, and suggests interpolation. Da, in rejecting the latter
halland uniting the first hali metrically with 517, has struck a probabIe
mean, whose naturalness is enhanced by the aposiopesis.

525. atqui, for atque of the MSS.. is unnecessary, since atque ln Ter. and
Plaut. is at times adversative. Gi. 225 and note.

527. ipsus gnatus: thus BD¹ G againstcupcpaynarus). Engelbracht
(Stadia Terent. p. 35) cites nine passages from Ten, in which ipsae is read
‘od letotom'eaitanoam: aod two ¹ propter ictum (ipsud) But these consid-

eratious do not apply here. Moreover in Heaut. 894, A, as well as other ’

Mea, has ipae pactus. Yet many editors, including Fleck, have failed ιο
restore ipae here. Not so Fairclough.

528. id rests on the authority oi Priscian (il. 243) alone, and is not neces-
sary to the sense; cf. Plaut. Pers. 245 jacite impetrem Uos. 214, 225 ooo
potes impetrare.

532. obuiam :rejected by Bentley, but possessing the support oi the
best MSS, as well as an obvious force in the passage. Schubert, Spen„
Fleck. and Fairclough rightly reject Chremem.

536. The first etis rejected by spen. and Da. to save paucis, which
most MSS. give rather than pauco. Meis.. Spen.,and1‹*1eck. have poncia.

and Meis. notes that elsewhere in Ter. (and in Plaut.) poues'e is usual. .

Yet pauco easily solves the metrical difficulty, was read by Priscian, is
found in Β, and is suggested by paucos oi P (i.

593. quid dixisti: Tyrrell reads: quid dieti? DA. dieti? Tha second
dieti, introduced by Tyrrell metet pretio, is difficolt. If Dauos is to be
made to repeat Simo’s question, he should rather say, ‘dietrami' (against
tharnetre). Moreover, as Dauos has said decidi before, he needs to aocent the
first syllable oi (ptume, in order that it may sound somewhat like thnici
bace. This is impossible in Tyrrell’s reading. 0n the other band, qaia
dicati, oi the text and most editions, ior quid dieti, is not quite satis·
