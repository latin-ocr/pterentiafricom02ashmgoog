Instead of using his prologus as a means of exponndlng to hle andience
the circumstances that condition the action of the play, and so much of the
plot as might be necessary to an appreciation of the events of the drama,
Terence has chosen tonse lor thie purpose a number of verses at the
opening of each play (in the Andria, vse. 28-171). There can be no doubt
that he was assisted in thie by hie models of the Neve Comedy, which must
have dealt with the plot in the first scene. In the Arenata, whose first scene
is based on the Perinthia (Περινθῐα) of Menander, Terence has chosen as his
model the pisy which presente its opening scene in the form of a dialogue,
in preference to the one which begine with a soliloquy-the plot being
substantially the same in both. ln doing this he takes into account the
’ peculiarities of a Roman andience‚ to whom the monologua of the Ἀνδρέα
would have seemed dull. Accordingto Donatus, who isour chief informant
on these points, this monologue is said hyan old man, whereas ln the Περινθία
an aged gentleman conversae with his wife. ln Terence the same person·
nge speaks with hisfreedman‚ who le an invention of the Latin poet himself.
Such a character however was merelya mechanical device to which Ter·
enee resorted according to his neede, and for which he had the authority of
Plautus. It was punem entra argumentum armato, as explained by Do-
natus, and had no part in the action oi the play. The Gk. πρόσωπον προτα-
τικόν was a similar oreation. Of such a nature are Philotis and Dauos in the
Hecyra and Phormio respectivcly.

28. Simo and hie freedrnan Sosia enter the stage from the right (see In-
trod. git). Behind them are two slaves carrying victuale purchased in the
forum. Simo sends the slaves within donne, but detaine Soela.

nos: i. c. slaves. istaec: i. e. the victuale. sosia, after his manu·
mission‚ remeius in the household of his former master, aud acts as over-
seer to the culinary department. In the scene-hesdinge of some MSS. he ls
designated as werae.

29. adesdum, “here, a moment ’'; often used ln recalling a person who
is about to take hie departure. Cf. 344: Hee. 510. The enclitic particle
dnm serves to modify the force ¹of the imperative, and so affecte the accent
that offlectam may be regarded as one word. Cf. n. on 184; Introd. ἓ 89.
For dnm see Lindsay, Lot. Lean. p. 609. paucis te uolo: i. e. paneis
nertin te nolo walveni (or adpellare); cf. Plant. Mil. 376 sed paucis neentis
