the hand of Antiphila in marriage, and in order that, through the betrothal
to himself of Chremes’ daughter, he may obtain from his father a sum oi
money ostensibly todeiray the expenses of the wedding. This money, how·
ever, would (presumably) he given by Clinia to Bacchis. But Chremes, as
Syrus suspects, refuses to be a party ιο any such scheme. Syrus must play
his trlcks upon Menedemus without making Chremes iu any way responsible
for the consequentes. Syrus thereupon suggests that Chremes should at
least reqnlte Bacchis ior the loss ol her attendant, Antiphila, aud pay ιο her
the ten minae for which Antiphila had been given to her as security by

r the anas Corinthio. See Syms' story as related in 66611. Tothisarrange-

ment Chremes at last agrees. He even'sends the money hy Clitipho in order
toassist Clinia in keeplng up his supposed pretence. Thus Chremes, ln
siding‚ as he imagines, the deception of Menedemus, is himself the real
dupe, and Syrus' success is complete.

749-756. biennem! uicem miseret me, “I am sorry now (lit. “in my

sugemem oi Syrus to see Chremes (757), as well as by the fact that Clinia
and Bacchis have suddenly departed from Chremes’ house aud taken up
their abode with Menedemus. Chremes falls as usual to bit the nall on the
head.
