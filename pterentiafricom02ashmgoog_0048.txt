INTRODUCTION 33

was not ¹accounted guilty of literary theft if he appropriated the work
of a Greek poet, provided the Greek play thus purloined bad not pre·
viously been translated into Latin, or in any way adapted to the Roman
stage, -provided‚ in short, the play was wholly “new'' to Roman
audiences. It was a matter of professional otiquette that a Greek play
once Latinized‚ in whole or in part, became through that process the
property of the person who Latinized it, -or if not entirely so, at least
to the extent to which it had been made to fumish material for a Latin
play. In defending himself in the prologue to the Adelphos against
this charge Terence explains that he incorporated in this play only
that part of the Synapothnescontes of Diphilus which Plautus, who had
Iatinized that comedy‚ had left untouched. In the prologus to the
Eunuchus also Terence defends himself against accusatione of a similar
character.

51. Of the six extarn Terentian comedies the Andria is the most
pathetic‚ the Adelphos in general more true tu human nature than the
rest, the Eunuchus the most varied and lively, with the largest number
of interesting characters, aud the Hecyra the one of least merit. All six
are remarkable for the art with which the plot is unfolded, through
the natural sequence of incidents and play of motivas. Strikiug effecte,
sharp contrasts and incongruities, which meet us iu many of the plays
of Plautus, are almost wholly absent All is smoth, consistent and
moderate, without any of the extravagance or exuberant humour, or
even oreative fancy, which characterize the writings of the older poet
But Terence was essentially an imitativa artist‚ aud his distinguishing
feature was his artistic finish‚—a fact fully recognized by Horace
(Epist. 2.1.59), whose appreciation of Terence eontrasts curicusly
with his estimato of Plautus.

52. All the plays of Terence may be said to bave met with success
before the death of their author, the Eunuchus perhaps having
aroused the keenest enthusiasm in the spectatore, who called for in

immediate repetition, if we may trust the statement of Suetonius:
Eunuchus quidem his dienato est. The Hecyra, on the other hand,
was attempted for the third time before it was pennitted to proceed to
aolose (cf. Phorm. Prol. 31 ff, Hoc. Proll. 1. and IL). But in general

the plays were less popular during Terence’s liietime than they after-
