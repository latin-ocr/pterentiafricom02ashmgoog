56 NOTES

cai. quibus: sc. nuptam the ahl. with the impers. potuerat quies& —a
rare constr, resting perhaps ou the analogy of such verbs as uocare and the
like. Transi. “how easily in fact could we have kept out of this marriage
ii this fellow hed been still.” hic: i. e. Dauos.

692. hic ε i. e. Pamphilus. instiga, “‚prick him on.”

693. ea res est, “such is the fact ''; with a refer. to 690. The remarks
of Charinus and Dauos are ignored by Mysis.

695. omnis homines: Pamphilus is thinking more particularly of his
father—a fact noted hy Donatus.

696. contigit (sc. hoec), “ fortune made her mine,” refers to the death oi
Chrysis and the latter's formal commitment of Glycerium to his care. See
ass-298. Don. seems ιο have understood coatiys't to he impers. So also
Fairclough, who reuders “ success hefell me‚'' ualeant qut, “away with
all who’'; cf. Aa. 622 euhoe and n., and the use of χαιρεινίι] Gk. Pamphilus
still has his father in mind, aud therefore expresses himself with cantion.

697. nemo: not aitte, for mors is personiiied; the allusion is to Simo.

698. resipisco, “Irecovermyself.'' Of. Heoat. 844. nagream
arque hoc, “more certain than this.'' atque, with the force of quom, after
comparativae, is mainly poetic, and is found more often in negative than
in positive constructions. The Delphie oracle served the Romans, as well
astho Greeks, as a standard of certainty, and allusione toits ‘¹ replies” are
ιο be found in the literature from Plautus to Cicero.

699. ut ne: purpose, not result; thus also in Act. 626, Transi. “if a
plan be set on foot ιο keep my father from helieving, etc.” stetisse:
impers.; freely, ·“that owing to my endeavours an obstacle has arisen in the
way of the fulfilment of this marriage. '¹

700. uolo, “very well,” ‘⁶ well and good.”

roi. Pamphilus means that he is prepared ιο take the consequenoes, if
circumstances render it necessary that his father attribute to him, and to
him alone, the responsihility for placing an obstacle iu the way of his
marriage with the daughter of Chremes. in procliui, “easy,” “likely to
befall‚” lit. “on the incline ”3 of. Plaut. Copt. 336 tom froc quidem tibi
ia procliui quom imber eat quomo plait.

702. quis uideor, “what do you think of me now i’' Understand titi. ι

fortis, “(you are) fine ”; ironical. For the omission of es cf. Au. 528 tosto
nequierand Hecot. 549 teoto melior. In expressions of an exclamatory
nature es, like at, is often dropped.

703. quod: see App. effectum reddam, “Iwillaehieve;” see on 683

· (inuentum dodo).

704. lam, “without delay.” See on 682. huic: i. e. Pamphilus. ne
erres: a flual cl. ; there is an ellipsis of the idea on which it immediately
depende, as e. g. “ (Ι say so) that you may make no mistake.”
