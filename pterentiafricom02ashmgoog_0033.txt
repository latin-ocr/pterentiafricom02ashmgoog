18 INTRODUCTION

· interference oi the tribunes on his behalf, and the fact of the existence
in Rome of a plebeian Geus Naeuia render it more probable that he
was by birth a Roman citizen.¹ Weight is added to this assumption
also by the strong political partisanship and bias, leaning always to
the side of the Plebs, which his plays exhibited. However this may
be, the fragments of Naevius which have reached us indicate that he
was a true Romania spirit at least, and thet he possessed unoommon ³
originality and power in his use of the Latin tongue.

30. The popularity of Naevius was thrown somewhat into the shade ᾗ
by his younger contemporary, Trrus Maccrus Pnaurus,² concerning
whose life very little is known. The year of Plautus' birth is uncer-
talu, but it was about 254 Β. c., and Sarsina, a town in Umbria, was
his birthplace. His parents were poor but free, and must have brought
him to Rome when a boy. There, according to Galliae, from whom the
principa] facts of his life are derived, he found employment quite early
in life iu operis artificum scaenicorum (Gell. 3. 3. 14), that is, in work γ
connected with the stage. The money he saved while thus engaged he ¹
lost subsequently in foreign trade. Returning to Rome he was reduced
to the necessity of working for hire in a treadmill. But his former l
associations with the theatra led him to attempt to turn his experience
to account, and he set to work to write plays. In this occupatiou he
discovered his true calling in life, when he may have been about thirty
years of age, and until his death in 184 Β. a. he devoted himself to the
business of making Latin versione oi Greek comedies. Of these he is
reported to have written one hundred and thirty (see Gell. 3. 3. 12).

31. The plays that have come down to us are twentyone in nurn-
ber, if we may include the Vidalaria, of which only a few fragments
have been preserved. The names ol the remaining twenty are : -

Amphitruo Oaslua Menaechmi Persa
Asinaria Cistellaria Mercator Rudeus
Aulularia Curculio Miles Gloriosus Stichus
Bacchides Epidicus Poeualas Triuuueueus
Captiui Mostellaria Pseudolus Trucculeutus
¹ See Sallen Roman Poets oftle Republic, 3d ed. p. 53.

² The still unsettled question of his full name ie discussed by Friedrich Leo,
Plautiniscle Forscluuyer, pp. 72 ff.
