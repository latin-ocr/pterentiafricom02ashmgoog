62 ¹ INTRODUOTION
important in a set of nine or perhaps of ten codices used by Bentley in

preparing his famous edition of Τοτοιιοο,1 and is referred ιο by Umpfen- l

bach (Praof. p. iii) as “ lying hid ’' in England, and as likely when found
ιο add valuable evidence ιο that already existing, in regard ιο the char-

acter of the original (lalliopian recension. This MS. had been lost to t

view for about 150 years after Bentley’s time, but was “ rediscovered,’'
subsequently ιο 1872, by an Oxford scholar, among the treasmes of

the Bodleian library, where it is frequently placed on exhibition, on ¹

account of the beauty of its minuscule writing and the very quaint
and interesting miniatures that adom its pages. These miniatures

may once have received a golden tint from the artist’s brush. An Χ

exhaustive account of the Dunelmenstr is given by Charles Hoeing
in the Amor. Joar. of Arcbaaoloyy, vol. iv (1900), pp. 310 ff. Itis
catalogued aa Auct. F 213. ·

104. (D) Corax Vrcronmrvus: cf the ninth or the tenth century,
and kept in the Laurentian library in Florence3 wherefore itis known
also as Codex Laurentianus. Certain of its folia belong ιο a cen-

tury later than the tenth, and are inferior ιο the rest² A peculiarity of ³

the Victorianus is a drawing on one of its fly-leaves, now hardly distin-
guishable. This drawing is not unlike the celebrated yroffito, which
has been supposed to be a caricature of the Crucifixion and may now
be seen in the Kircherian Museum at Rome. According ιο Dr. Emil
Gutjahr, who has made the drawing the basis of an argument on the
history of the Codeta, the Victorianus is certainly as old as the ninth
century.8 It presente the plays in the following order: Andr, Aa,
Ilua, Pacem, Hwat, Hm. 'lhe catalogue number is xxxvm.
