38 INTRODUCTION

ol the fabulae palliatae, it was not recognized by them ae a practica}
expedient. Terence, for example, even if he divided his plays into acts
in writing them, would not have ventured to keep his audience waiting ÷
alter the play had began. The attention ol the people at the public .
gemes, where the plays were exhibited, was too easily diverted by
other attractione, such as gladiatore, pugilists‚ or tightrope deucere.
But it is probable that neither Plautus nor Terence thought ol any
system of division into acts, such as we have mentioned. In their time
the action of the play was continuone ς or if peuces were needed here
and there for technical reasons, their place and number were deter-
mined, not by the poet, but hythe stage manager, the audience being ³
entertained in the interval by a flute-player, as in the Pseudolus of
Plautus (ci. 571-573 b). The intermissicn in the Pseudolus was .
evidently regarded by Plautus himself as exceptional, and ae a special
concession to the exigencies oi the performance. Moreover the manu-
scripts of Plautus and Terence contain only slight traces of a division
into acts, and the Greek originale undoubtedly were pellormed with·

out any regular break or pause in the action of the play. Even the
. words ol Horace (A. P. 189-90), -

Neue minor neu rit quinto productior actu
Fabula, qnae posci nult et spectata reponi, ·-

were intended to refer to tragedy rather than comedy, and are based
upon what was regarded as conventional by Alexandrian critice. And
again the expression, primo octa placeo, in the prologus to the Hecyra
(39), although it contains an apparent allusion to a division into acts,
is certainly nothing more than an equivalent for ia primo fabulo.

58. But if a division into acts was foreign to the plays of the New
Attio Comedy, this cannot be said with the same truth of the plays ol
Aristophanes, whose choral divisione correspond so closely to the five
acts already mentioned, that the law laid down lor tragcdy by the
critics oi Alexandria would seem to hold good also ior the Old Attio
Comcdy. That the parallel does not maintain itseli where the comedy ol
Menander is concerned is owing to the absence in general of the chorus, ,

· whose place, if filled at all in the later comedy oi Athens, must have
been taken by the performances oi the αὐλητήέ. Of. Plaut. Pseud. 571.
