PREFAGE

ΙΝ this edition of the six extant comedies of Terence Ι have
adopted, substantially without change, the text of Professor
Robert Yelverton Tyrrell, published by the Clarendon Press

Professor Tyrrell’s permission Ι have corrected afew very

of the publishers to have their own text annotated, but is owing
chiefly to the conviction that Dniatzlro's text is, on the whole, in· -
ferior to the laterone of Professor Tyrrell, who had not only

the foot of each page of the text. These footnotes have enabled
me considerably to abbreviate my own critical appendices, which
are to be taken as supplementary to the Latin footnotes.

In the preparation of the Notes I have tried to make Terence,
