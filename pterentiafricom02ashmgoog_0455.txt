01 the affeloeoi Pamphilus and Glycerium the real interest in the plot ceases.
Accordingly Terence brings the play to 1 01011 with 11 little attention es
possible to further matters oi detdil. It is probable however that vs. 981

could now be transferred to him without undue litigation. (11. Meissner's n.

employment in the theetre is said by Livy (vii. 2) to have been due to
Liuius Andronicus, who, to save hls voice, introduced upon the stage 1
young slave, end stationed him near the flutepleyer. The business 01 this

In all oi Terence’s plays the best MSS. use the symbol e 10 mark the

both Sulpicius Apollinaris (earlier than 150 s. 1.), Donatus end Engraphius '
were aware 01 111 existence. It is considered spurious by Don. end rejected
by Euge, and is very corrupt in some oi its lines. Moreover the iact that
its concluding verses ere in lambio senarii, while the lest lines 01 every
other play 01 Terence are in trochaic septenarii, is against the assumption
of a Terentian authorship. For the latest word on the subject see 1111-
