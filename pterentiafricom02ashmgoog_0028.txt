INTRODUCTION 13

oi the elementa which have been described as existing in Rome before
the introduction there, 011 an extensive scale, of the literature of Graece.
Bnt during this early period there was little leisure or inclination at
Rome for the cultivation of poetry and lettera Roman activity was
occupied with affairs of stata-with the passage of lawe, the main·
tenance of armies, the extensior oi Roman power and influence over
Latium and the rest of Italy, the building up of the state onita prae-
tical and material side. Moreover a moral stigma rested at Rome on
the profession of the actor, which disconraged the composition and
performanee of plays by native citizens. It was to be expected, there·
fore, that the Latin drama, whether tragic or comio, should have been,
onita more refined and cultivated side at least, an importation; and
auehit actually was. Greek literature and civilitation began to make
their way toward Rome after the defeat of Pyrrhus and the fall 'oi
Tarentum in 27 2 a. c. Before the war with Pyrrhus there had been

the highly finished drama oi Athens. Nor should it be iorgotten by
those who see in Roman comedy only a reflection or a transplanting
oi Greek models, tbat the native Italian clement constituted a distinct
factor in the actual elaboration ol the new drama. This is apparent
in the plays oi Plautus, which exhibit a singular mixture of Roman
coarseness with Greek refinement, oi homespun mother wit with ior·
eign thought and philosophy, not to mention the most absurd anachro-
nisms, and direct allusione to Roman habits and customs, ior which the
Greek originale could in no degree be held responsible.

22. With Livius Andronicus a new era begins. Through him the
Roman stage became elevated at once to a dignity almost comparabis
to that of the Greek. The plays of Livius were regular dramas, how·
ever much they may have suffered through translation. Now for the
first time both tragedy and comedy in their completeness, having a well
