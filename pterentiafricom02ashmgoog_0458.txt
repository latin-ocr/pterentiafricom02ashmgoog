876. uerear: 'generally accepted on the authority 01 Dl and Ο, but uereor

10 supported by PD²B and M (8011100, Scholia Terent. p. 18), and is

ἵ better suitedtothe strong feeling 01 the speaker. ·

Umpf.,spen.,1)z.,n1eck. (in both editions) unite in the substitution 01
genium 101 ingenium. The former seems to have been known as a variant
to Don. and was adopted by Bentley ; 01. 1101. Epist. 1. ’1. 94. The arrange-
ment involving the least departure irom the MSS. reading 10 given by
Fleck. (let ed.): quod ipo per 11000 te dextram oro 0100011101 tuom, altered to

' pnwd 010000 te, etc, in sd ed. The latter arrangement has good support;

01.884,588; Plaut. llud. 6273 Liv. 23. 9. 2. It isadopted by Da.. who how·
ever is obliged to borrow nunc irom Eugr. 101· the sake 01 the mette-a
'difficulty skillfully avoided by Flcck through transposition: quod per epo
te cestram Mne oro et genium tuom. ¹

299. accerso: the form favoured sytrienses, which vary between it and
arcesso.

332. spiscler: thus 0100 Da. here aud in Phcrm. 408, where Hauler now
reads adipiscier with the MSS. Spen. adipiscier, rightly. See his note.

845. cuge, Chsriuer Spen. (afterBentley)scans cupi. notwithstanding
elye, and cites cupae 01 the MSS. and Plaut. Bcclr. 1105, Most. 260. Thus he
gete rid 01 0, which was introduced by Fleck. on the authority 01 old edi-
110110, and accepted by Dz. SeeJahn'sN. Janru. latapetra. But see note.

347. certo: MSS. certe, which is perhaps best when hercle follows, 00 iu

¹ And. 495, Plrorvn. 5233 bu't when hercle precedes there 10 good MSS. evidence

in support 01 certo, which Dz. and Fairclough accept on the authority 01 A
in Pomm 164. cf. Plaut. 1100. 314, and see Schlee‚ Scholia Terent, p. 311.

369. ierne: Tyrrell prefers fere (sc. tulit), ior which 000 Du, Acin. Urit.

who follow Don. MSS. make no division. ⁴

388. hoc: that this was the only iorm 01 theodulum 111 use up to the
time 01 the Roman emperors hasbeen pointed out by Buecheler (Lat. Deel.
p. 102). 80 Engelbrecht, Studia Terent, p. 70. 5.

389. hic: it is better to punctuate the question at tecum, and take iric 00
00 adv. (= “hereupon,'’ 01 “ thereupon ’') with reddes, 00 Meis. does. Dz.‚
though ho follows Spen. in the matter 01 punctuation, yet remarks (Ado.
onst), 0100111001,Μο pron. pers, carc puto,

lea. elus: Dz. (Acin. Urit.) refers to Plaut. Pocn. 1188, 101 the double
gen. But, 00 Fairclough says, no pron. is needed here in view 01 the pre·
ceding illi. The common text (the conjecture 01 Erasmus) will answer,
which is merely a rearrangement 01 the MSS. reading. See however 8011-
clough‘s note.
