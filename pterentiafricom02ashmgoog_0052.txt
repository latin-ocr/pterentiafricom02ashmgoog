chus in Sir Charles Sedley's Bellamirasthe two old men of the Adcl-
phos, Micio and Demea, have suggested the leading characters in
Cumberland’s Choleric Mon and Shadwell's Squire os Aitolia. In
lact, the influence cf Terence upon dramatis literature and literary
style has been profonnd.

56. The Cussscrnns in the plays of both Plautus and Terence are
in general representative or typical‚ like those ol the later Athenian
comedy. At least they lack something of that definite personality which
we look for in a play of Shalrespeare. The repetition ol the same name
in different plays tsnds to emphasize this lach of definiteness. But the
characters of Terence are more faintly drawn than those ol Plautum
the latter have greater individuality‚ and are more often suggestive of
the personages of Shakespeare and other modern dramatists. The
principal figures in Terence’s mamas are the following: two old rnen,
one severe, the other mild and indulgent; two young rnen, one openly

’ dissipated, the other exemplary, -at least until his true character is
disolosed; an *msam a leno ; a parasite; a simple-minded and faith-
ful slave, and one that is intriguing and oralty. Tbere are also the
ancillo or maid-servant, ¹the matrona or anxious mother, and the long·

lost daughter who appears first in the person of an deicere, bnt is .

ultimately discovered to be an Athenian citizen. The motive of each
pisce is love, which at first takes the form of irregular passion, hut

ends always in a marriage satisfactory to all concerned. The scene is ¹

invariably at Athens, or (as may possibly be the case in the Heauton
tinwracanos) in its near neighbourhood. The time of the action is
seldom more than a single day.

57. Each play is mvmsn mro nvn sons. This division was made
by scholare of the sixteenth century, who perhaps were influenced by
Donatus. The latter (Proef. in Adelph.) speaks of a division into
five acts, but adds: quos (amus) etsi retinendi caasa iam inconditi
epactam minime distinguant Latini mmai, manentes scilicetnequis
fastidiosas finito uota, uelut adnuntias obeaudi, reliquos comoedica
fiat contemptor, et carpat. With this ¹compare what the same com·
mentatcr says elsewhere (Praef. ia Eua.) ι tenendi spectatoris causa
aaut poatukuoster omnes quiaque actas calatonem fieri. Hence, .
although the division into acts may have been known to the writers
