ayo. It is a neut. substantive likewise in tlre expression istnc aetatis ( =e¹d
1111111, (lic), “at your age''; see Heout. 110. It is an adv. = “to that

¹ point of·yours,’' in Heneti. 274 11111Αά. 821. ea: 11. the course ofcon-

duct pnrsued hitherto by Pamphilus, to which reference is mado in qaod

187. mtebar:dissy11abie. See Introd. §uu

188. tempus: the same as 1111111 tempus in Hac. 1194. 01443 cetas=
“youth’' tunt: intrans. through the ellipsis of ae (cf. Knapp’s Vergil,

, Introd. ξ 189) ; ‘⁶ was suited to,’' mora lit. ‘¹ bore upon.” sini: sc. enm rem.

As the subj. after this verb is never introduced by ut in Pleut.‚ it is well
1ο take 1111 absolutely here and nt 11111111 as an adv. cl. of purpose =
“in order that, etc.'' But the nt-cl. ln Hac. 590 clearly stands in objectiva
relation to sinam, and may be warrant for a similar construction here.

189. hic dies: cf1na.

190. dehinc: temp.. ‘⁴ from thia time on,’' ⁴⁶ henceforth.” siue: 11111.
11 ulam, “tc the right way''; 1111 on 442 (1111); Cic. Philipp. xii. 2. 'l

191. hoc quid ait may depend on royac understood (cf. An. 288), asif Dauos

had locked inquisitiva or surprised. or had actually said 1111 quid eet? und
Simo were repeating his question in the answer. Α question eohoed or re-

peated is mentally dependent and may have the subi. See ou 282. Cf. Au.
84, 374. qni amant: hiatus, with a shortening of the vowel, isallowed
when a monosyllabis bearing the ictus and ending in a long vowel orm
stands before awnrd beginning witha vowel. See Introd. ἓ 97. Of. Ritsehl,
Proleyomenn 11 Tria. 1001.

199. magistrum: in thia instance Dauos himself. (11.1. on 54. cam
nm: the fact stated in 191. inprobum, ‘⁶ bad‚'' “ ill-disposed.''

198. ipsum aegrotum, “itself love-sich ”t cf. 559. ipsum has the force
of “without the promptings of a teeoher.'’ ad deteriorem partem,
‘⁴ upon (toward) the inferior course of action.'’ adplicat, ¹‘ sets.'’ ‘¹ guides.”

194. non oedipus: lam no guesser of riddles, says Dauos. and by this
he suggests a resemblance between Simo and the Sphinx—an insinuation
that would have amused the audience. Plautus (Pocn. 443) says: -

Nam isti quidem hercle 1111111111 Oedipo
Opus 1611111111, qui Sphingi interpres fuit.

‘ 196-8. ’1111 change of metre is significant. The former lines being in
recitative, the change to spoken lines (lambio senarii) gives particular pro-
mineuce to the conditione therein set forth aa those nuder which Simo will
fuliil his threat; but the details cf the threat itself are unfoldcd in tha more

ἵ wcighty octonarii which follow (199, 200).
