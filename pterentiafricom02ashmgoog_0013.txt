viii PREFACE

edit 11011 01 the Captivi But the plat 10100 the In tt'roduc tron had
been cast before Dr. Robert Kauer's revision 01 Dziat zkos 011-
00101 1οἆ edition 01 the 1101011100 had come 10 my notice. The
same is true 01 the Adelpdoe as edited byE. Stampini (Turin,
1891), and 01 the editions 01 ,J aequmst (1891), 01 Pessonneaux
(1894), 01 Psiohari (1895), and 01 Βουό (1898). Conse-
quently these editions are not mentioned in the Introduct' 11.011
But I have been able to take into account especially the work 01

Dr. Rauen, while I have been revising the Notos 011 111οΑ101110οω

Iwish to express my gratitudo to friends who have aided me.
To Professor Harold W. J ohnston 01 the Indiana University I
owe the suggestion in which 1110 book originated, as weil as
other suggestions which were helpful while the manuscript was
in course 01 preparation. To Professors Gonzaiez Lodge and

Charles Knapp of Columbia UniversityI am under deep obli· ⁵

gation 101 encouragement and assistance ungrudgingly bestowed
while the book was passing through the¹ press. Professor Lodge
has read the larger part 01 the procis and has made many impor-
· tant corrections and suggestions Professor Knapp has read the
proofs throughout, and in doing so has given both the Introduction
and the Notos a 00101111 revision. His extensive familiarity with
Plautino and Terentiam usage, his constructive scholarship, and
his discriminating criticism have been continually 01 my service
⁸ from 1110 time when the first proof sheets were received from the
press, more than two aud 0 hali years ago. To his corrections

aud additions the book owes much 01 any 1010011 may be found

to ossess.

11001111 must express my appreciation 01 the ‘efforts 01
the proprietors 01 the Riverside Press 10 have the book both
becomingly and accurately printed.
