INTRODUCTION 9

songs of the Dionysiac festivals were apparent the seeds from which
sprang the artistic comedy of Athens. The name has been derived
from Fescennium, a village in Etruria. Such a local origin of the term
acquires support lrom the unquestioncd connection of the Atellan plays

with Atella in Campania3 but it is more probable that the name is
connected with fuscinam, a word deuoting primarily the evil eye, and
subsequently the symbol which was supposed ιο avert it, and which
was often carried in processioa in Italy, just as the phallic emblem
was carried by the Greeks.¹

16. A demand, however, came to bc felt for something less rude
than the Veron Fescenniui, which were iu consequence sornewhat ¹

altered and improved, and united with music and mimic dancing.
This, according to Livy (7. 2), was accomplished by certain of the
Roman youth, who undertoolr to imitate the performances oi Etruscan
actore called ludiones. The ludiones performed in pantomime to the
sonnd of the flute, but, as Livy says, sine carmine cle. While going
through the mimic steps and gestures, after the manner ol the Etru·
riam, the young men would repeat cloud a series of verses of a respon-
sive and jocular nature. These, though no longer wholly improvised,
were yet of the general character of the Fescennina verses, and out of
the combination grew the saturne, which, according to Livy, were in-
pletae modes, descripto ium cd tibicinem cunta, that is, regularly set

ιο music. The Etruscan dancers were brought tc Rome in the year ’

364 n. c, and a stage—the first ever set up in Rome—was erected
ior their accommodatiori in the Circus Maximus. The occasion of their
introduction was a desire on the part of the people to add to the regu-
lar programma of the Ludi Rauraci something in the nature of scenic
performances, with a general view ιο the 'enrichment oi the greatest
of the Roman festivals, and the pacificatiorl-'thereby of the gods who
had visited the city with a pestilence. The result was the Satara (sc.
sabech) already mentioned, which, though devoid of any connected
plot, yet, as representing soenes from daily life, was more nearly of the
nature of drama than the Fescennina verses had been. The saliuae
were in fact merry medleys performed by the country lads of Latium
