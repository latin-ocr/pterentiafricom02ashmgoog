J Notwithstanding the ieet that a new act is here indicated, Simo must be
ἲ supposed ιο remain on the stage, where he lingere until vs. 205, in apparent
disregard of his promise atlil to follow Sosia into the house. But amnon·
need not be interpreted ιοο literally, and Simo naturally takes advantage oi
the sudden appearance oi Dauos, to wem the slave against any attempt ιο
thwart him in his plans regarding Pamphilus.
³ 1va. Simo recalls to mind that Dauos exhibited considerable anxiety on
hearing oi Chremes' offer oi his daughter in marriage. As Dauos is the ac-
eempliee oi Pamphilus, this reflection causes Simo ιο give emphatic expres-
sion to what now arnouuts to a conviction, via, that Pamphilus will prove
unwilling ιο enter the bonds of matrimony. Previously (155-158) Simo had
entertained doubts on this point.

177. Since the event mentioned in 148, Simo has maintained strict silence
(178), a fact somewhat inconsistent with the interpretation of those corn-
mentators who will have it that Simo stepped into the house at 171 and
gave orders iu the presence oi Dauos ior the pretendcd marriage. 'llrose
who interpret thus understand 173 ιο refer to these orders. ¹But vs. 173
